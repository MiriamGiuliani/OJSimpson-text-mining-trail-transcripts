    "The main goal of this step is to import the data scraped from the website and pre-process it. This is achieved with the function ```preprocessing_transctipts_text()```, whose main steps are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- removing __html tags__\n",
    "- removing __blank lines__\n",
    "- __isolate the part of the transcript where people actually talk__ (i.e. text between the words _SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA_, present at the very beginning and at the end of each transcript) from the descriptive part, storing them in separate files\n",
    "- __eliminate spaces__ between different paragraphs of the part of the dialogs where the same person is talking\n",
    "- __isolate the person talking__ from the actual dialog; this is done by exploiting the fact that because of how the HTML file has been pre-processed, the name of the person talking has the # symbol before and it is followed by a colon (with regex this means isolating the following: ```re.search(r'\\#.*?\\: ', line)```)\n",
    "- __find the date and the time of the transcript__ (with regex) \n",
    "- __create a dataframe__ with the following columns: _person_ (person talking), _speach_ (part of the dialog told by the person), _date_ (date of the transcript), _time_ (timestamp of the transcript). The first row of such data frame should contain the descriptive part of the transcript in the _speach_ column, having the value _DESCRIPTION_ for the _person_ column)\n",
    "- manage the __witness questioning__, identifying the witness answering the questions -> SUBSTITUTE 'A: ' with the witness name. The name of the witness is retrieved by looking at particular formulas as _CALLED AS A WITNESS BY_, _THE WITNESS ON THE STAND AT THE TIME_, _HAVING BEEN PREVIOUSLY SWORN_, before the questioning. The names of all the witnesses of the transcript are stored in a list\n",
    "- manage the __attorney questioning__, identifying the attorney making questions -> SUBSTITUTE 'Q:' with the name of the attorney questioning.  The name of the witness is retrieved by looking at particular formulas as _CROSS-EXAMINATIONBY_, _DIRECT EXAMINATIONBY_,_CROSS-EXAMINATION \\(RESUMED\\)BY_, _DIRECT EXAMINATION \\(RESUMED\\)BY_, before the questioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "More details about this can be found in the report. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note__: I am aware that the function is not as efficient as it could be, but the data was very dirty and I didn't have much time. I spent a lot of nighttime hours writing this, so be kind and appreciate the effort.\n",
    "As someone once said, _the plural of regex is regrets_, if you know, you know :)"
