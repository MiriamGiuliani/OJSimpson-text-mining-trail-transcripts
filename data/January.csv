#THE COURT: ,"COUNSEL, WHY DON'T YOU USE THE PODIUM WITH THE MIKE.
","JANUARY 11, 1995 ",9:05 A.M.
#MS. WITHEY: ,"YOUR HONOR HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE PAPERS AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY DID PREPARE A RESPONSE TO THOSE PAPERS WHICH SETS FORTH THE ISSUES THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ADDRESSED.SOJOURN WOULD LIKE TO HAVE CERTAIN SPECIFIC FINDINGS MADE; AND IF THOSE FINDINGS ARE MADE, THEN WE FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH PROVIDING WHATEVER DOCUMENTS ARE LEGALLY ALLOWED TO BE PRODUCED.OUR FIRST CONCERN WAS THAT THE TRUSTEE, LOUIS BROWN, BE AUTHORIZED TO INSTRUCT A COUNSELOR OF THE PROGRAM TO PERMIT DISCLOSURE. SOJOURN IS CONCERNED THAT STRICT CONFIDENTIALITY MAY BE MAINTAINED AS SET FORTH IN THE EVIDENCE CODE, AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS NOT BE COMPELLED. HOWEVER, THE CODE SECTION VERY SPECIFICALLY SETS FORTH CERTAIN CONDITIONS UPON WHICH DISCLOSURE MAY BE COMPELLED BY THE COURT.THE SUBPOENA THAT WAS RECEIVED BY THE PROJECT DIRECTOR HAD ATTACHED TO IT A PURPORTED WAIVER EXECUTED BY LOUIS BROWN. SO ONE OF OUR FIRST ISSUES WAS WHETHER OR NOT THE TRUSTEE CAN INSTRUCT THE COUNSELOR OF THE PROGRAM TO PERMIT DISCLOSURE AS IS SET FORTH IN THE EVIDENCE CODE.THE SECOND ISSUE IS WHETHER OR NOT THE WAIVER ITSELF, WHICH WAS ATTACHED, IS SUFFICIENT.THERE WAS AN INITIAL WAIVER THAT WAS ATTACHED TO THE SUBPOENA AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY A DIFFERENT WAIVER WAS PROVIDED BY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WHICH WAS MORE SPECIFIC AND WHICH ADDRESSES ITSELF SPECIFICALLY TO SOJOURN, WHICH I THINK IS BETTER.AND THIRDLY, IF THE COURT FINDS THAT THE TRUSTEE IS AUTHORIZED TO PERMIT -- IS AUTHORIZED TO INSTRUCT THE COUNSELOR TO PERMIT DISCLOSURE AND THE WAIVER IS ADEQUATE TO PERMIT DISCLOSURE, WE WOULD LIKE A FINDING UNDER THE EVIDENCE CODE OF 1037.5, SUBSECTION (C) THAT THE COUNSELOR AND THE PROGRAM MAY NOT CLAIM THE PRIVILEGE.THERE IS, I THINK, I SUBMIT, SOME AMBIGUITY IN THAT PARTICULAR STATUTE. I THINK MS. BODIN AND I AGREE THAT THERE IS TWO PARTS TO THAT SECTION.ONE PART SAYS THAT IF A VICTIM IS ALLEGED TO BE DECEASED, THE COURT MAY HAVE AN IN CAMERA HEARING TO DETERMINE IF THE DISCLOSURE CAN BE COMPELLED. IN ANOTHER SECTION, IT SAYS THAT IF THE HOLDER OF THE PRIVILEGE IS DECEASED, THEN THE COUNSELOR MAY NOT CLAIM THE PRIVILEGE.SO WE'RE WANTING YOUR HONOR TO MAKE A FINDING THAT THE DOCUMENTS ATTACHED TO THE SUBPOENA ARE APPROPRIATE AND THAT THE PRIVILEGE CANNOT BE CLAIMED BY THE COUNSELOR IF THAT IS THE CASE. IF THAT IS THE CASE, THEN THE -- THEN DISCLOSURE MAY BE MADE.IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE'RE ASKING FOR A MODIFICATION OF ONE OF THE REQUESTS BECAUSE OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH IT WOULD REQUIRE AN EXTENSIVE SEARCH BY SOJOURN, WHICH IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION AND DOES NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES.
","JANUARY 11, 1995 ",9:05 A.M.
#THE COURT: ,"WHAT MODIFICATION ARE YOU ASKING FOR?
","JANUARY 11, 1995 ",9:05 A.M.
#MS. WITHEY: ,"ITEM NO. 1 OF THE SUBPOENA ASKS FOR -- REQUESTS DOCUMENTS FROM MARCH 1ST, 1977, WHICH IS WHEN SOJOURN BEGAN, TO JUNE 12, 1994. AND THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 3,000 CALLS A YEAR THAT COME INTO THIS SHELTER. AND SO, THEREFORE, IF YOU DO THE ARITHMETIC, APPROXIMATELY 54,000 DOCUMENTS.NOW, THAT'S WHAT WAS REQUESTED. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WANT TO MODIFY THIS.I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH MR. DARDEN, WHO INDICATED THEY I BELIEVE DID NOT HAVE ANY OBJECTION TO PROVIDING A REASONABLE COST TO AN EMPLOYEE OF SOJOURN -- AND INDEED, IT HAS TO BE AN EMPLOYEE OF SOJOURN BECAUSE WE CAN'T HAVE SOMEONE FROM OUTSIDE OF SOJOURN SEARCHING THROUGH PRIVILEGED DOCUMENTS OBVIOUSLY -- BUT EMPLOYEE OF SOJOURN TO GO THROUGH THE RECORDS AND AT A REASONABLE HOURLY RATE -- TYPICAL RATE FOR THE ACTUAL EMPLOYEES THERE IS ABOUT $10 AN HOUR -- TO GO THROUGH AND SEARCH THE DOCUMENTS FOR WHAT IS REQUESTED.AND WE WOULD BE -- WE WOULD DO THAT IN COMPLIANCE WITH A COURT ORDER, ASSUMING THAT THERE WERE CERTAIN FINDINGS WHICH YOUR HONOR MADE WITH REGARD TO THE PRIVILEGE INITIALLY.THERE'S ALSO A REQUEST TO HAVE, IF YOUR HONOR COMPELS DISCLOSURE, A REQUEST FOR AN IN CAMERA HEARING WITH REGARD TO THE NATURE OF THE DOCUMENTS THAT ARE --

#THE COURT: ,"GOOD MORNING.
","JANUARY 11, 1995 ",9:05 A.M.
#MS. BODIN: ,"GOOD MORNING.LYDIA BODIN REPRESENTING THE PEOPLE.COUNSEL HAS SPECIFICALLY ASKED THE COURT TO MAKE FINDINGS WITH REGARD TO WHETHER OR NOT THE PRIVILEGE CAN BE CLAIMED BY SOJOURN; AND I AM GOING TO ASK THE COURT TO MAKE THE FINDING THAT SOJOURN IS NOT WHO IS THE PRIVILEGE HOLDER.UNDER EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 1037.5, IT SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COUNSELOR CANNOT CLAIM THE PRIVILEGE IF NO HOLDER IS IN EXISTENCE. HOLDER IS FURTHER DEFINED IN EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 1037.5 AS EITHER BEING, ONE, THE VICTIM, OR TWO, THE GUARDIAN OR CONSERVATOR.NEITHER ONE OF THOSE ARE IN EXISTENCE. OBVIOUSLY THE VICTIM IS DECEASED AND THERE IS NO GUARDIAN OR CONSERVATOR.SECONDLY, EVEN ASSUMING THAT THE COURT IS ENTERTAINING THE IDEA THAT SOJOURN CAN CLAIM THE PRIVILEGE, I BELIEVE THAT THE WAIVER THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN BY THE EXECUTOR OF THE ESTATE, LOUIS BROWN, IS SUFFICIENT TO OVERCOME ANY CLAIM OF PRIVILEGE.THE -- IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ESTATE IS NOT ONE OF THE HOLDERS OF THE PRIVILEGE AND ARGUABLY COULD NOT THEN WAIVE.BUT IF THE COURT RECALLS THAT SECTION, I THINK THE COURT CAN MAKE AN ANALOGY TO THE PRECEDING PRIVILEGE, WHICH IS THE SEXUAL ASSAULT COUNSELOR PRIVILEGE, WHICH INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COUNSELOR PRIVILEGE REFERENCES INTO, ALTHOUGH IT IS SILENT WITH REGARD TO WHETHER OR NOT AN EXECUTOR CAN BE A PRIVILEGE HOLDER AS TO THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COUNSELOR PRIVILEGE.
","JANUARY 11, 1995 ",9:05 A.M.
#THE COURT: ,"THEN DON'T THE RULES OF STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION REQUIRE THAT I ASSUME THAT SINCE THE LEGISLATURE MENTIONED OR ACKNOWLEDGED THE EXISTENCE OF A SCHEME AND BY ITS ABSENCE IN THIS STATUTE CHOSE NOT TO INCLUDE THAT? I MEAN DON'T I HAVE A ASSUME THAT UNDER THE CODE?
","JANUARY 11, 1995 ",9:05 A.M.
#MS. BODIN: ,"THAT IS A CONFUSING STATUTE. COUNSEL ALLUDED TO THAT.I THINK THERE'S SOME CONFUSION BETWEEN 1937.2, WHICH TALKS ABOUT THE PROCEDURE, THE IN CAMERA PROCEDURE, THAT THE COURT MAY FOLLOW ITS OBVIOUS DISCRETION. THE LANGUAGE OF THE STATUTE IS ""MAY"". IT'S NOT ""SHALL FOLLOW THIS PROCEDURE.""IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE IN THIS SECTION, IT TALKS ABOUT THE IN CAMERA PROCEEDING. IT CITES NOT THE PROCEDURE FOR THE SEXUAL ASSAULT PRIVILEGE.AND THAT PROCEDURE REQUIRES A BALANCING TEST WHERE YOU TAKE THE PROBATIVE VALUE OF THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE RECORDS AND BALANCE THEM AGAINST THE EFFECT OF THE TREATMENT. THAT ASSUMES A LIVING VICTIM. WE DON'T HAVE A LIVING VICTIM HERE.IT IS CONFUSING, AND I THINK COUNSEL IS CORRECT IN REQUESTING THE COURT TO MAKE CERTAIN FINDINGS. BUT I THINK THAT THE COURT WOULD NOT HAVE TO GET TO MY SECOND AND THIRD ARGUMENTS I THINK MERELY BY THE TERMS OF THE STATUTE.THEY CAN'T CLAIM THE PRIVILEGE AND, THEREFORE, THEY SHOULD TURN OVER THE RECORDS.
","JANUARY 11, 1995 ",9:05 A.M.
#THE COURT: ,"ALL RIGHT.MS. BODIN, HOW DO WE HANDLE THE PRACTICAL OBJECTION THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH, POTENTIALLY HAVING TO SORT THROUGH BETWEEN 50- AND 60,000 DOCUMENTS AND AN EMPLOYEE OF SOJOURN IS GOING TO HAVE TO DO THIS, AND WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR IT.
","JANUARY 11, 1995 ",9:05 A.M.
#MS. BODIN: ,"INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, A BOARD MEMBER OF SOJOURN HAS PUBLICLY MADE A STATEMENT WITH REGARD TO WHEN NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON MADE A CONTACT WITH THE SOJOURN SHELTER NEARING THAT TIME TO RIGHT -- I BELIEVE IT WAS THE LATE 1980'S. I THINK THAT THAT WOULD CERTAINLY BE A BEGINNING POINT FOR SOJOURN. THAT'S ALREADY BEEN PUBLICLY IDENTIFIED.SO THEY HAVE A PLACE TO BEGIN.

#THE COURT: ,"BUT YOUR SDT ASKS FOR MARCH OF '77.
","JANUARY 11, 1995 ",9:05 A.M.

#THE COURT: ,"WELL, THEY'RE ASKING FOR 10 BUCKS AN HOUR, WHICH IS MORE THAN TWICE THE MINIMUM WAGE AS IT STANDS TODAY.
","JANUARY 11, 1995 ",9:05 A.M.
#MS. BODIN: ,"IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A RECORD CHECK IS A PRETTY SIMPLE THING. I THINK IT SIMPLY COULD BE DESCRIBED TO THE PERSON LOOKING. I THINK THAT COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED FAIRLY RAPIDLY.I'M FAMILIAR WITH WHAT LOGS LOOK LIKE AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LOGS LOOK LIKE IN SHELTERS, AND IT'S JUST MERELY LOOKING FOR A NAME. THAT'S ALL IT IS. AND I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT MUCH WORK. I THINK IT'S TIME CONSUMING, BUT IT'S NOT DIFFICULT WORK AND SOMETHING THAT WARRANTS $10 AN HOUR.

I THINK IT WOULD BE A GRAVE INJUSTICE, AN INSULT TO THE FAMILY TO EXCLUDE THEM FROM THIS HEARING OR ANY HEARING OR ANY PORTION OF THE TRIAL IN THIS MATTER.THEY HAVE A VESTED INTEREST AND EXTREME INTEREST IN THESE PROCEEDINGS AND THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO STAY. WHO HAS A GREATER INTEREST? WHO HAS SUFFERED A GREATER LOSS THAN THE GOLDMAN FAMILY AND THE BROWN FAMILY?THE COURT HAS DISCRETION, AND WE WOULD URGE THE COURT TO ALLOW THE BROWN FAMILY TO REMAIN DURING THESE PROCEEDINGS.

#MR. UELMEN: ,"THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.WHILE, AS YOUR HONOR IS CERTAINLY WELL AWARE, THIS IS A MOTION THAT COVERS A GOOD DEAL OF POTENTIAL TESTIMONY AND EVIDENCE AT THIS TRIAL, I THINK THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OVERRIDING GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES, ESPECIALLY RELATED TO THE ADMISSIBILITY OF CHARACTER EVIDENCE, RELATED TO THE ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE OF EXPERTS, RELATED TO PARTICULAR SYNDROMES AND RELATED TO THE HEARSAY RULE AND ITS EXCEPTIONS THAT WILL HELP US CUT THROUGH MANY OF THE INDIVIDUAL INCIDENTS AND PERHAPS SET SOME GENERAL GUIDELINES THAT WILL ASSIST THE COURT IN ADDRESSING ALL OF THIS EVIDENCE.AS I READ THE PEOPLE'S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT'S MOTION IN LIMINE, IT REMINDED ME OF MY OWN BRIEF BUT STELLAR CAREER AS A PROSECUTOR. I WAS ASSIGNED TO THE ORGANIZED CRIME DIVISION OF THE OFFICE, AND THAT IS WHERE I FIRST ENCOUNTERED THE POWER OF THE LABELS THAT WE PUT ON CRIMINAL CASES.WE ACTUALLY HAD A RUBBER STAMP THAT WE WOULD STAMP ON THE FILES ""ORGANIZED CRIME DIVISION"" IN THREE-INCH LETTERS. AND WHEN WE MARKED A NEW CARD, WE WERE VERY CAREFUL TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS EXPOSED SO THAT EVERYBODY KNEW THIS WAS AN ORGANIZED CRIME CASE.AND IT TRANSFORMED THE PROCEEDINGS. THE DEFENDANT SUDDENLY BECAME MORE SINISTER. THE DEFENSE LAWYERS BECAME MORE MENACING. AND PROSECUTORS OF COURSE ARE WELL AWARE OF THE POWER OF LABELS.TODAY OF COURSE, WE DON'T NECESSARILY RELY ON RUBBER STAMPS. WE HAVE 35-INCH VIDEO SCREENS TO PUT LABELS ON CASES.BUT THE LABEL THAT THE PROSECUTION WANTS TO PUT ON THIS CASE IS ANNOUNCED IN THEIR RESPONSE TO THE MOTION AT PAGE 3 WHEN THEY SAY IN SHORT, ""THIS IS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE INVOLVING MURDER, NOT A MURDER CASE INVOLVING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.""AND BY ATTACHING THAT LABEL, BY SAYING THIS CASE IS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE, THEY SEEK TO TRANSFORM THESE PROCEEDINGS FROM AN INQUIRY INTO WHO KILLED NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON AND RONALD GOLDMAN ON JUNE 12TH, 1994 INTO A GENERAL INQUIRY INTO THE CHARACTER OF O.J. SIMPSON IN WHICH HE WILL BE CALLED UPON TO EXPLAIN EVERY ASPECT OF HIS LIFE FOR 17 YEARS.AND THERE IS A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM WITH WHAT THE PROSECUTION IS TRYING TO DO HERE. I THINK THAT PROBLEM WAS SUMMONED UP BY WHAT JUDGE MEDKA (PHONETIC), NOW WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL, STATED IN THE CASE OF UNITED STATES VERSUS BAESKE WHEN HE SERVED ON THE DISTRICT OF COLOMBIA COURT OF APPEALS IN 1980.HE SAID:""IT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO AMERICAN JURISPRUDENCE THAT A DEFENDANT MUST BE TRIED FOR WHAT HE DID, NOT FOR WHO HE IS.""NOW, WE HAVE AN UNUSUAL DEFENDANT IN THIS CASE IN TERMS OF A DEFENDANT BEGINNING WITH A RESERVOIR OF PUBLIC REGARD, A GOOD REPUTATION, AND WE'VE SEEN THE IMPACT OF A PUBLIC CAMPAIGN TO CHANGE THAT. WHAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT CAMPAIGN BEING BROUGHT INTO THIS COURTROOM UNDER THE GUISE OF EVIDENCE OF BAD CHARACTER.AND THE CALIFORNIA EVIDENCE CODE ADHERES TO SOME VERY IMPORTANT GENERAL RULES TO EFFECTUATE THAT GENERAL PRINCIPAL THAT SOMEONE SHOULD BE TRIED FOR WHAT HE DID RATHER THAN WHO HE IS; AND THAT RULE QUITE SIMPLY PROVIDES THAT A DEFENDANT CANNOT BE CONVICTED BY SHOWING HIS BAD CHARACTER OR PROTENSITY TO COMMIT CRIME.THAT IS OF COURSE EMBODIED IN SECTION 1101(A) OF THE EVIDENCE CODE, WHICH PROVIDES:""EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION AND SECTIONS 1102 AND 1103, EVIDENCE OF A PERSON'S CHARACTER OR A TRAIT OF HIS OR HER CHARACTER, WHETHER IN THE FORM OF AN OPINION, EVIDENCE OF REPUTATION OR EVIDENCE OF SPECIFIC INSTANCES OF HIS OR HER CONDUCT IS INADMISSIBLE WHEN OFFERED TO PROVE HIS OR HER CONDUCT ON A SPECIFIED OCCASION.""NOW, IT'S IMPORTANT I THINK TO NOTE WHERE IN THE EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 1101 APPEARS.IT APPEARS IN PROVISION 9, WHICH IS HEADED, ""EVIDENCE AFFECTED OR EXCLUDED BY INTRINSIC POLICIES.""THIS EVIDENCE IS KEPT OUT NOT BECAUSE IT'S STRICTLY IRRELEVANT, THAT IT WOULD OFFER NO ASSISTANCE TO THE RESOLUTION OF FACTUAL ISSUES. IN FACT, WE'RE TOLD IN THE SAME PROVISIONS OF THE EVIDENCE CODE THAT THE DEFENDANT, IF HE CHOOSES, CAN PRESENT EVIDENCE OF GOOD CHARACTER. AND AS YOUR HONOR IS AWARE, A STANDARD JURY INSTRUCTION INFORMS THE JURY THAT EVIDENCE OF GOOD CHARACTER ITSELF CAN RAISE A REASONABLE DOUBT.SO IT'S NOT THAT CHARACTER EVIDENCE BY ITSELF HAS NO RELEVANCE WHATSOEVER. THE REASON FOR THIS RULE OF EXCLUSION IS BECAUSE THIS EVIDENCE IS SO LIKELY TO BE MISUSED, TO BE USED FOR THE WRONG PURPOSE, TO BE GIVEN GREATER WEIGHT THAN IT TRULY DESERVES.SO AT THE OUTSET, I THINK IT'S HELPFUL TO ASK WHAT ARE THE INTRINSIC POLICIES THAT ARE SERVED BY SECTION 1101(A) AND ITS EXCLUSIONARY RULE.AND THE BEST SUMMARY I GUESS OF THE INTRINSIC POLICIES THAT UNDERLAY SECTION 1101 WAS OFFERED BY JUSTICE FRANK RICHARDSON OF THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT, WHO HAS A WELL-DESERVED REPUTATION FOR GETTING RIGHT TO THE POINT WITH PRECISION, AND HE CERTAINLY DID SO IN THE CASE OF PEOPLE VERSUS THOMAS, 20 CAL. 3D 457 AT 464.HERE'S WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE POLICIES THAT UNDERLAY SECTION 1101:""AS WE EXPLAINED IN CRAMER AND KELLY, THE PURPOSES OF THE FOREGOING EXCLUSIONARY RULE ARE THREEFOLD.""ONE, TO AVOID PLACING THE ACCUSED IN A POSITION IN WHICH HE MUST DEFEND AGAINST UNCHARGED OFFENSES.""SECONDLY, TO GUARD AGAINST THE PROBABILITY THAT EVIDENCE OF SUCH UNCHARGED ACTS WOULD PREJUDICE DEFENDANT IN THE MINDS OF THE JURORS;""AND THIRD, TO PROMOTE JUDICIAL EFFICIENCY BY RESTRICTING PROOF OF EXTRANEOUS CRIMES.""IN BRIEF, HE CONCLUDED:""ALTHOUGH DEFENDANT'S PRIOR CRIMINAL ACTS MAY DEMONSTRATE HIS BAD CHARACTER AND HIS PROPENSITY OR DISPOSITION TO COMMIT THE CRIME CHARGED, A DEFENDANT IS NOT TO BE CONVICTED BECAUSE THE PROSECUTION CAN PROVE ON HIS PRIOR RECORD THAT HE IS A BAD MAN.""NOW, EACH OF THESE POLICIES THAT JUSTICE RICHARDSON ENUMERATED IS OF PARTICULAR RELEVANCE TO THIS MOTION AND THIS CASE.FIRST OF ALL, THE PROBLEM OF PUTTING THE ACCUSED IN THE POSITION OF HAVING TO DEFEND AGAINST UNCHARGED CONDUCT.NOW, BY THE INFORMATION FILED IN THIS CASE AFTER THE PRELIMINARY HEARING IN JUNE, MR. SIMPSON WAS PUT ON NOTICE THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO DEFEND AGAINST A CHARGE THAT HE MURDERED NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON AND RONALD GOLDMAN ON JUNE 12TH, 1994.NEARLY EACH WEEK SINCE THEN, THE BREATH OF THE CASE HAS EXPANDED CALLS UPON MR. SIMPSON TO SEARCH FOR EVIDENCE TO EXPLAIN EVENTS THAT TOOK PLACE MANY YEARS AGO.AND JUST ON MONDAY OF THIS WEEK, THE PROSECUTORS FILED AN ADDENDUM TO THEIR RESPONSE TO THIS MOTION SUGGESTING THEY WOULD OFFER EVIDENCE OF NEIGHBORS WHO LIVED IN AN APARTMENT NEXT DOOR TO MR. SIMPSON IN 1977, 1978, AND WHO HEARD LOUD ARGUMENTS.WE WERE TOLD THAT MR. SIMPSON WOULD HAVE TO EXPLAIN THE REPORT OF A FOOTBALL FAN WHO CLAIMS THAT HE SAW MR. SIMPSON ON THE BEACH IN 1986 OR 1987 STRIKING A FEMALE COMPANION.NOW, TRY TO IMAGINE WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE ON TRIAL IN A CASE LIKE THIS WHERE THE CHARGES GROW AS FAST AS THE TABLOIDS CAN SUPPLY NEW FODDER. IT IS TRULY KAFKAESQUE.YOUR HONOR COMPILED A LIST WITH A TOTAL OF 59 SEPARATE ITEMS WHICH ARE NOW IN ISSUE, AND THE LIST KEEPS GROWING, AND THAT'S A CONCERN. IT'S A CONCERN TO ANY DEFENDANT AND IT'S A CONCERN ADDRESSED BY SECTION 1101 WHEN, AS JUSTICE RICHARDSON PUT IT, WE NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT PUTTING THE ACCUSED IN THE POSITION OF HAVING TO DEFEND AGAINST CONDUCT WHICH IS NOT CHARGED, WHICH IS SIMPLY BEING ADDED TO THE CHARGES.AND I THINK IT'S QUITE IRONIC THAT MUCH OF THE CONDUCT THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT COULDN'T BE CHARGED EVEN IF THE PROSECUTION WANTED TO BECAUSE THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS HAS LONG ELAPSED, AND IT'S IRONIC THAT THIS CAN BE DRAGGED IN AS KIND OF A CABOOSE TO A SEPARATE TRIAL RELATING TO CHARGED CONDUCT.THE SECOND POLICY THAT JUSTICE RICHARDSON MENTIONED IS TO GUARD AGAINST THE PROBABILITY OF PREJUDICE. AND THE POSSIBILITY OF PREJUDICE IN THIS CASE IS NOT ONLY REAL; IT IS MEASURABLE.I THINK THE MOST SOPHISTICATED EFFECT OR EFFORT TO MEASURE THE POTENTIAL PREJUDICE OF THIS KIND OF EVIDENCE WAS THE CLASSIC STUDY OF JURY BEHAVIOR BY PROFESSORS CALVIN AND SIDEL, IN WHICH AFTER STUDYING A WHOLE SPECTRUM OF JURY TRIALS, THEY CONCLUDED THAT THE RATE OF ACQUITTAL BY JURIES DROPPED FROM 42 PERCENT TO 25 PERCENT SIMPLY UPON LEARNING THAT THE DEFENDANT HAD A PRIOR CRIMINAL RECORD.I THINK YOU CAN ALSO JUST LOOK AT THE IMPACT ON THE PUBLIC OPINION POLLS IN TERMS OF THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF MR. SIMPSON'S GUILT BEFORE AND AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE 911 TAPES BACK IN JUNE AND JULY, A VERY MEASURABLE PERCEPTIBLE EFFECT SHOWING THAT THE IMPACT THAT THIS KIND OF EVIDENCE HAS IS FAR IN EXCESS OF THE WEIGHT THAT IT SHOULD BE ACCORDED.IN THE MOST RECENT EFFORT TO ADDRESS THE MYRIAD OF ISSUES RELATED TO THE ADMISSION OF THIS KIND OF EVIDENCE, PEOPLE VERSUS EWOLDT, DECIDED IN FEBRUARY OF LAST YEAR BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT, JUSTICE GEORGE NOTED THE SPECIAL DANGER OF PREJUDICE WHERE THE PRIOR CONDUCT WAS NOT THE SUBJECT OF A CRIMINAL CONVICTION.AND I THINK IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT ONLY ONE OF THE PRIOR INCIDENTS THAT THE PROSECUTION WILL SEEK TO UTILIZE IN THIS CASE ACTUALLY WAS LITIGATED AND ENDED IN A CONVICTION BASED ON MR. SIMPSON'S PLEA OF NO CONTEST.JUSTICE GEORGE POINTED OUT IN EWOLDT:""THE PREJUDICIAL EFFECT OF THIS EVIDENCE IS HEIGHTENED BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT DEFENDANT'S UNCHARGED ACTS DID NOT RESULT IN CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS.""THIS CIRCUMSTANCE INCREASED THE DANGER THAT THE JURY MIGHT HAVE BEEN INCLINED TO PUNISH THE DEFENDANT FOR UNCHARGED OFFENSES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT CONSIDERED HIM GUILTY OF THE CHARGED OFFENSE AND INCREASED LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSING THE ISSUES BECAUSE THE JURY HAD TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE UNCHARGED OFFENSES HAD IN FACT OCCURRED.""THE THIRD POLICY THAT JUSTICE RICHARDSON LAID OUT FOR US WAS THE PROMOTION OF JUDICIAL EFFICIENCY BY RESTRICTING THE PROOF OF EXTRANEOUS CRIMES.EACH OF THE INDIVIDUAL INCIDENTS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT IN THE COURSE OF THIS MOTION WILL REQUIRE A MINI TRIAL IN ITSELF. I CAN ASSURE THE COURT THAT THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO EVERY ONE OF THESE ALLEGED INCIDENTS.THE CREDIBILITY OF THE WITNESSES WHO ARE PRESENTING THESE INCIDENTS WILL ITSELF BE SUBJECT TO CHALLENGE. IN MANY CASES, THE WITNESSES HAVE ALREADY EXHIBITED BIAS BY PUBLICLY ANNOUNCING THEIR OWN CONCLUSIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE GUILT OR INNOCENCE OF THE DEFENDANT.MEMORIES ABOUT THESE INCIDENTS WILL DIFFER WIDELY AS WE REACH FURTHER BACK, IN SOME CASES, TO EVENTS 17 YEARS AGO; AND THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THIS EVIDENCE WILL FREQUENTLY RAISE A 403 QUESTION UNDER THE EVIDENCE CODE, A PRELIMINARY ISSUE OF FACT THAT RELATES TO THE RELEVANCY OF THE EVIDENCE REQUIRING THE COURT TO ACTUALLY MAKE A DETERMINATION IN ADVANCE WITH RESPECT TO THE RELEVANCY OF THE EVIDENCE AND THEN INSTRUCTING THE JURY THAT THEY NEED TO DISREGARD IT IF THEY FIND THAT IN FACT THESE INCIDENTS DID NOT OCCUR.AND THERE WILL BE VERY COMPLEX JURY INSTRUCTIONS REQUIRED WITH RESPECT TO EACH OF THESE INCIDENTS.SO CERTAINLY THE PROMOTION OF JUDICIAL EFFICIENCY WILL BE FURNISHED BY RESTRICTING PROOF OF EXTRANEOUS CRIMES AND DEMANDING THAT THIS CASE REALLY FOCUS ON THE EVENTS OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED ON JUNE 12TH RATHER THAN REACHING BACK.NOW, THERE ARE OF COURSE FOUR VERY CAREFULLY LIMITED EXCEPTIONS TO SECTION 1101(A), AND THREE OF THOSE EXCEPTIONS ARE WHERE THE DEFENDANT HIMSELF CHOOSES HIMSELF TO PUT CHARACTER IN ISSUE.FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE DEFENDANT CHOOSES TO OFFER EVIDENCE OF GOOD CHARACTER, THAT EVIDENCE CAN OF COURSE BE REBUTTED BY THE PROSECUTION UNDER SECTION 1102 AND THEY CAN PRESENT EVIDENCE OF BAD CHARACTER RELATING TO THE SAME TRAITS OF CHARACTER.SECONDLY, IF A DEFENDANT OFFERS EVIDENCE OF THE VIOLENT CHARACTER OF A VICTIM IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN A CLAIM OF SELF-DEFENSE, THE PROSECUTION CAN THEN PUT IN ISSUE THE DEFENDANT'S OWN REPUTATION FOR VIOLENCE. BUT AGAIN, IT'S BECAUSE THE DEFENDANT HAS OPENED THE DOOR BY CHALLENGING THE CHARACTER OF THE VICTIM. HE THEN INVITES A CHALLENGE TO HIS OWN CHARACTER.AND THAT OF COURSE WILL NOT TAKE PLACE IN THIS TRIAL.THIRDLY, IF THE DEFENDANT TESTIFIES, THE DEFENDANT OF COURSE PUTS HIS OWN CHARACTER FOR TRUTH AND VERACITY IN ISSUE. HE CAN BE IMPEACHED THE SAME AS ANY OTHER WITNESS UNDER SECTION 780 OF THE EVIDENCE CODE, AND EVIDENCE THAT REBUTS HIS FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS IN THE COURSE OF HIS TESTIMONY MAY BE PRESENTED IN REBUTTAL.FINALLY -- AND THIS IS THE CATEGORY OF EXCEPTION THAT I THINK WE WILL BE FOCUSING OUR ATTENTION ON TODAY -- IF THE EVIDENCE OF CHARACTER OF SPECIFIC INSTANCES, SPECIFIC ACTS IS RELEVANT TO PROVE A FACT OTHER THAN PROPENSITY BASED ON THE SIMILARITY OF THE ACT, THAT BECAUSE THE PRIOR ACT IS SIMILAR TO THE CRIME THAT WE ARE LITIGATING IN THIS CASE, WE CAN INFER THAT BOTH ACTS WERE DONE WITH THE SAME MOTIVE OR BOTH ACTS WERE DONE WITH THE SAME INTENT OR INDEED BOTH ACTS WERE DONE BY THE SAME PERSON TO SHOW IDENTITY, THEN THE ACT MAY BE RELEVANT FOR A PURPOSE OTHER THAN PROPENSITY.AND THAT OF COURSE IS THE EXCEPTION LAID OUT IN SECTION 1101(B).NOW, THE PROSECUTION -- AND I THINK THIS IS A THRESHOLD ISSUE THAT YOUR HONOR MAY NEED TO CUT THROUGH IN TERMS OF DEALING WITH THE ISSUES RAISED BY THIS MOTION -- IS SEEKING TO ADD A FIFTH EXCEPTION TO THE FOUR THAT WE FIND IN THE EVIDENCE CODE IN SECTION 1102, 1103, 780 AND 1101(B).AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS FIFTH EXCEPTION IS NOT FOUND IN THE EVIDENCE CODE. NOWHERE IN THE EVIDENCE CODE IS THERE ANY REFERENCES TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES OR RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASES OR ANY SUGGESTION THAT A SPECIAL RULE OR A SEPARATE MODE OF ANALYSIS APPLIES TO ANY SUCH CASE.AND THEY BASE THIS ASSERTION ON DICTA IN A SINGLE COURT OF APPEAL OPINION, PEOPLE VERSUS ZACK, WHICH IS THE ONLY AUTHORITY THEY CAN FIND TO JUSTIFY THIS ASSERTION THAT SOMEHOW, RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASES ARE TO BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY THAN ANY OTHER CASES AND THAT ALL PRIOR INCIDENTS BECOME ADMISSIBLE IN A RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASE.PEOPLE VERSUS ZACK REALLY DOES NOT STAND FOR THAT EXCEPTION. OUR CONTENTION IS THAT IT'S NOT CREATING A NEW EXCEPTION AT ALL, BUT SIMPLY APPLYING AN OLD ONE.AND THE OLD EXCEPTION THAT IT'S APPLYING IS THAT WHEN A DEFENDANT TESTIFIES AND PUTS HIS CHARACTER IN ISSUE THROUGH HIS OWN TESTIMONY, RATHER THAN PRESENT A FALSE AURA OF THE RELATIONSHIP THROUGH HIS TESTIMONY, THE PEOPLE CAN REBUT THAT TESTIMONY AND SHOW THE PRIOR ACTS THAT COUNTER THE DEFENDANT'S ATTEMPT TO CHARACTERIZE THE RELATIONSHIP IN A PARTICULAR WAY.THE KEY FACTOR I THINK IN PEOPLE VERSUS ZACK IS THAT THE DEFENDANT TESTIFIED IN ZACK AND THAT THIS EVIDENCE WAS THEN OFFERED TO REBUT HIS TESTIMONY AFTER THAT TESTIMONY WAS PRESENTED.I THINK ZACK ALSO PRESENTS AN EXAMPLE OF THE TRADITIONAL EXCEPTIONS LAID OUT IN SECTION 1101(B) IN TERMS OF THE REMARKABLE SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE PRIOR ABUSIVE INCIDENTS, ALL OF WHICH OCCURRED WITHIN THREE OR FOUR YEARS OF THE MURDER AND THE MURDER ITSELF.THE COURT POINTED OUT:""GIVEN THE BRUTAL AND UNIQUE NATURE OF THE MURDER, APPELLANT'S PRIOR ASSAULTS OF NECESSITY COULD NOT SURVIVE A DISTINCTIVE MODUS OPERANDI ANALYSIS.""THE DISTINCTIVE BRUTAL AND UNIQUE NATURE OF THE MURDER IN ZACK WAS THAT THE VICTIM WAS LITERALLY BEATEN TO DEATH. BOTH OF HER ANKLES WERE BROKEN. SO OF COURSE, PRIOR ASSAULTIVE BEHAVIOR MAY HAVE HAD SOME RELEVANCE WITH RESPECT TO THE CHARGE BROUGHT AGAINST THE DEFENDANT IN THAT CASE.THE REAL PROBLEM FOR THE PROSECUTION IN THIS CASE IS THE TOTAL LACK OF ANY SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE PRIOR ALLEGED ACTS AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS CRIME.LABELING THAT A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE OR LABELING IT AS A RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASE REQUIRES A NEW DEFINITION. IT REQUIRES US TO SAY, ANY TIME ANY VICTIM OF A MURDER HAD A PRIOR RELATIONSHIP, THEN ALL OF THE EVIDENCE REGARDING THAT PRIOR RELATIONSHIP CAN BE BROUGHT IN IF THE PARTY TO THAT RELATIONSHIP IS CHARGED WITH THE MURDER.THAT'S AN INCREDIBLY BROAD PROPOSITION.NONE OF THE TRADITIONAL EARMARKS OF A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR A RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE HOMICIDE ARE PRESENT HERE.HOW MANY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASES INVOLVE MULTIPLE VICTIMS?HOW MANY INVOLVE THE COMMISSION OF A MURDER WITH THE USE OF A KNIFE?HOW MANY INVOLVE A COMPLETE SILENCE PRECEDING THE MURDER, SUGGESTING THAT THE MURDER WAS COMMITTED BY STEALTH RATHER THAN BEING PRECEDED BY ANY SORT OF VIOLENT CONFRONTATION OR ARGUMENT?IN FACT, IF WE HAD TO PUT A LABEL ON THIS CASE BASED ON THESE FACTORS, THE LABEL WE WOULD PUT ON IT IS THAT IT BEARS ALL OF THE EARMARKS OF A DRUG-RELATED HOMICIDE IN WHICH THE FREQUENCY OF MULTIPLE VICTIMS, THE USE OF KNIVES, THE USE OF STEALTH IS MUCH MORE FREQUENT THAN IT IS IN THE CASE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.NOW, IF WE TAKE THESE PRIOR INCIDENTS ONE AT A TIME -- AND WE CERTAINLY WILL AND YOUR HONOR WILL OF COURSE BE REQUIRED TO LOOK AT EACH OF THESE INSTANCES INDIVIDUALLY.BUT I THINK GENERALLY, WE CAN SAY THAT NEARLY ALL OF THESE INCIDENTS INVOLVED LOUD ARGUMENTS, THEY INVOLVED A CONFRONTATIONAL ESCALATION OF A SITUATION IN WHICH THE DEFENDANT AND HIS SPOUSE, NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, WERE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO EACH OTHER AND THE SITUATION THEN ESCALATED INTO A LOUD ARGUMENT.THEY FREQUENTLY INVOLVED THE BREAKING OF GLASS, PICTURE FRAMES. VERY FEW OF THESE INCIDENTS INVOLVED ANY PHYSICAL ASSAULT AT ALL TO THE EXTENT PHYSICAL ASSAULTS ARE ALLEGED. THOSE ASSAULTS ARE ALL SLAPS AND PUNCHES. THERE IS NEVER ANY ALLEGATION OF ANY USE OF A WEAPON IN ANY OF THESE INCIDENTS AND MANY OF THE INSTANCES INVOLVE DRINKING ON THE PART BOTH OF MR. SIMPSON AND OF HIS WIFE.SO A KEY QUESTION TO ASK AS WE LOOK AT EACH OF THESE INCIDENTS IS, WHAT ARE THE SIMILARITIES, WHAT ARE THE COMMON FEATURES BETWEEN WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THESE INCIDENTS AND WHAT WENT ON ON THE NIGHT OF JUNE 12TH.AND AGAIN, WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT A VERY USEFUL GUIDE, AND ESPECIALLY USEFUL BECAUSE IT IS THE MOST RECENT WORD FROM THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT ON THIS COMPLEX ISSUE, APPEARS IN THE EWOLDT OPINION AND THE OPINION OF JUSTICE GEORGE, BECAUSE HE ATTEMPTS TO DESCRIBE IN SOME DETAIL THE DEGREE OF SIMILARITY REQUIRED FOR THREE OF THE THEORIES RELIED UPON HERE;THAT THE PRIOR INCIDENTS ARE ADMISSIBLE TO SHOW INTENT ACCOMPANYING THE MURDER ON JUNE 12TH, THAT THEY ARE PART OF SOME SORT OF COMMON DESIGN OR PLAN, AND ULTIMATELY THAT THEY WILL PROVE THE IDENTITY OF THE PERPETRATOR.NOW, ADDRESSING EACH OF THESE FORMS OF ADMISSIBILITY EXCEPTIONS TO ALLOWING PRIOR CONDUCT EVIDENCE, JUSTICE GEORGE INDICATES THAT A GREATER DEGREE OF SIMILARITY IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO PROVE A COMMON DESIGN OR PLAN THAN IS REQUIRED TO PROVE INNOCENCE.BUT EVEN WITH RESPECT TO INTENT, HE MAKES IT QUITE CLEAR THAT IN PROVING INTENT, THE ACT IS CONCEDED OR ASSUMED THAT THIS KIND OF EVIDENCE IS RELEVANT TO SHOW THE STATE OF MIND OF THE ACTOR ONCE WE ASSUME OR CONCEDE THAT THE ACTOR DID THE ACT; AND THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES WHETHER HE DID IT WITH THE REQUISITE INTENT OR STATE OF MIND. AND WE DRAW AN INFERENCE THAT BECAUSE THE ACTOR ALSO DID THESE PRIOR ACTS WITH A PARTICULAR INTENT OR STATE OF MIND, WE CAN INFER THAT HE DID THIS ACT WITH THE SAME INTENT OR STATE OF MIND.NOW, THAT OF COURSE IS NOT THE CASE HERE.THE ISSUE IN THIS CASE IS GOING TO BE, WHO DID THIS ACT ON JUNE 12TH. SO WE'RE NOT ASSUMING OR CONCEDING THAT MR. SIMPSON DID THE ACT AND INQUIRING WHAT HIS STATE OF MIND WAS WHEN HE DID THE ACT.IT'S QUITE CLEAR FROM THE PLEADINGS FILED BY THE PROSECUTION THAT WHAT THEY WANT TO INFER IS IDENTITY. THEY'RE SAYING, ""IF WE CAN SHOW THE ACTS WERE DONE WITH THE SAME INTENT, FROM THAT, WE CAN THEN INFER THE IDENTITY OF THE PERPETRATOR.""SO THEY'RE REALLY SEEKING TO EVADE THE GREATER DEGREE OF SIMILARITY THAT IS NECESSARY TO SHOW IDENTITY BY KIND OF BOOTSTRAPPING IT ON THE TAIL OF THIS THEORY OF SHOWING INTENT WHEN THE INTENT THEORY OF COURSE ASSUMES OR CONCEDES THE IDENTITY OF THE PERPETRATOR.JUSTICE GEORGE THEN GOES ON TO POINT OUT THAT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ACTS BEING PART OF A COMMON DESIGN OR SCHEME, THAT THE SIMILARITY MUST BE NOT JUST A SIMILARITY IN THE RESULTS, BUT SUCH A CONCURRENCE OF COMMON FEATURES THAT THE VARIOUS ACTS ARE NATURALLY TO BE EXPLAINED AS CAUSED BY A GENERAL PLAN OF WHICH THEY ARE INDIVIDUAL MANIFESTATIONS.SO AGAIN, IN APPLYING THIS EXCEPTION, WE ARE CALLED UPON TO LOOK FOR THE SIMILARITY, LOOK FOR THE CONCURRENCE OF COMMON FEATURES BETWEEN THESE PRIOR ACTS AND THE ACT THAT THE DEFENDANT IS ON TRIAL FOR.AND THEN JUSTICE GEORGE CONCLUDES:""THE GREATEST DEGREE OF SIMILARITY IS REQUIRED FOREVIDENCE OF UNCHARGED MISCONDUCT TO BE RELEVANT TO PROVE IDENTITY. FOR IDENTITY TO BE ESTABLISHED, THE UNCHARGED MISCONDUCT AND THE CHARGED OFFENSE MUST SHARE COMMON FEATURES THAT ARE SUFFICIENTLY DISTINCTIVE SO AS TO SUPPORT THE INFERENCE THAT THE SAME PERSON COMMITTED BOTH ACTS.""THE PATTERN AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CRIMES,"" HE SAYS, ""MUST BE SO UNUSUAL AND DISTINCTIVE AS TO BE LIKE A SIGNATURE.""AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE GOT TO LOOK FOR IN EACH OF THESE PRIOR INCIDENTS.WHERE ARE THESE SIGNATURE FACTS THAT RECUR IN THE EVENTS THAT TOOK PLACE ON JUNE 12TH, 1994?IDENTITY IS THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE IN CONTENTION IN THIS TRIAL. AND OF COURSE, THE RISK OF PREJUDICE OF THIS KIND OF EVIDENCE IS THE GREATEST WHEN IT IS USED TO SHOW FACTS THAT ARE NOT REALLY IN ISSUE IN THE CASE.JUSTICE SYSTEM GEORGE MAKES THAT POINT IN EWOLDT; THAT WHEN WE'RE USING PRIOR ACTS TO PROVE FACTS THAT ARE NOT REALLY IN ISSUE IN THE CASE, THAT'S WHEN WE HAVE THE GREATEST DANGER THAT THE EVIDENCE WILL BE MISUSED FOR A PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT IS NOT ADMISSIBLE.AND THAT PURPOSE IN THIS CASE IS SIMPLY IDENTITY, TO SHOW WHO IT IS WHO COMMITTED THIS CRIME.NOW, AFTER FINDING ENOUGH SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE PRIOR ACTS AND THE ACT OF JUNE 12TH TO JUSTIFY THE USE OF THE 1101(B) EXCEPTION, THE COURT MUST THEN PROCEED TO ANALYZE EACH INCIDENT AS WELL IN TERMS OF SECTION 352 OF THE EVIDENCE CODE, LOOKING AT WHETHER THE PROOF OF THIS INCIDENT WOULD REQUIRE UNDUE CONSUMPTION OF TIME IN TERMS OF THE WITNESSES REQUIRED IN ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE RESOLVED WITH RESPECT TO ADMISSIBLE EVIDENCE.SECONDLY, THE SUBSTANTIAL DANGER OF UNDUE PREJUDICE. AND IT IS HERE THAT THE QUESTION OF REMOTENESS IS OF PARTICULAR RELEVANCE.THE RISK OF CONFUSION OF THE ISSUES OF WHETHER THE JURY WILL REALLY BE ABLE TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS THAT TELL THEM THEY CAN ONLY USE THIS EVIDENCE FOR A LIMITED PURPOSE.AND FINALLY, THE DANGER OF MISLEADING THE JURY.IF WE FOCUS ON THE REMOTENESS OF THESE INCIDENTS, ON THE DEGREE OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN THESE INCIDENTS AND WHAT HAPPENED ON JUNE 12TH, ON THE PRESENCE OF PHYSICAL ABUSE IN THESE PRIOR INCIDENTS, AND THAT I THINK EVEN IF WE CONCEDED THAT, PEOPLE VERSUS ZACK STANDS FOR THE PROPOSITION FOR WHICH THE PROSECUTION HAS CITED IT.THE RULE STATED IS THAT:""PRIOR ASSAULTS UPON THE SAME VICTIM MAY BECOME ADMISSIBLE.""AND WE NEED TO ASK AS TO EACH OF THESE INCIDENTS WHETHER THEY ACTUALLY INVOLVED A PHYSICAL ASSAULT ON THE VICTIM.I THINK APPLYING THOSE TESTS TO EACH INCIDENT, WE WILL CONCLUDE THAT VIRTUALLY NONE OF THE EVIDENCE SOUGHT TO BE ADMITTED CAN BE ADMITTED IN THIS TRIAL BECAUSE IT IS SIMPLY IRRELEVANT TO THE QUESTION OF WHAT HAPPENED ON JUNE 12TH.NOW, I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE ON TO THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES GOVERNING THE USE OF EXPERT WITNESSES WITH RESPECT TO PARTICULAR SYNDROMES BECAUSE THE PROSECUTION HAS ANNOUNCED ITS INTENT OF CALLING TO THE WITNESS STAND IN THIS CASE AN EXPERT WITNESS ON THE BATTERED WOMAN'S SYNDROME TO EXPLAIN THAT SYNDROME TO THE JURY.AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE PUT THAT SYNDROME BACK IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT IT WAS DEVELOPED TO EXPLAIN.THE BATTERED WOMAN'S SYNDROME WAS DEVELOPED TO EXPLAIN THE IMPACT ON THE VICTIM OF BATTERING, TO EXPLAIN WHY SUCH A VICTIM WOULD REMAIN IN A BATTERING RELATIONSHIP, TO EXPLAIN THE STATE OF MIND OF THAT VICTIM WITH RESPECT TO ANY CORRECTIVE ACTION THE VICTIM MAY HAVE TAKEN AGAINST THE BATTERER. ITS PURPOSE WAS NOT TO PREDICT THE CONDUCT OF THE PERPETRATORS OF BATTERING BEHAVIOR.AND WHAT THE PROSECUTION IS PROPOSING HERE IS NOT A TRADITIONAL USE OF THE BATTERED WOMAN'S SYNDROME, WHICH HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE COURTS AND AUTHORIZED BY THE EVIDENCE CODE IN SECTION 1107. BUT WHAT THEY ARE PROPOSING IS THE ONE USE OF THIS EVIDENCE THAT IS SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITED BY SECTION 1107 OF THE EVIDENCE CODE, WHICH PROVIDES THAT:""EXPERT EVIDENCE OFFERED BY EITHER THE PROSECUTION OR THE DEFENSE REGARDING BATTERED WOMAN'S SYNDROME, INCLUDING THE PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL OR MENTAL EFFECTS UPON THE BELIEVED PERCEPTIONS OR BEHAVIOR OF VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS ADMISSIBLE EXCEPT WHEN OFFERED AGAINST A CRIMINAL DEFENDANT TO PROVE THE OCCURRENCE OF THE ACT OR ACTS OF ABUSE WHICH FORM THE BASIS OF THE CRIMINAL CHARGE.""AND THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT THEY PROPOSE TO DO WITH THE BATTERED WOMAN'S EXPERT; TO CALL THAT EXPERT TO PROVE THE OCCURRENCE OF A MURDER BY O.J. SIMPSON, TO SHOW THAT THE MURDER WITH WHICH HE IS CHARGED ON JUNE 12TH IS PART OF A PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR THAT THEY PLAN TO EXPOUND THROUGH THE PRESENTATION OF THIS EXPERT.AND THAT OF COURSE IS THE ONE USE THAT IS PROHIBITED BY SECTION 1107. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE PUT SECTION 1107 INTO ITS CONTEXT OF WHY IT WAS ENACTED AND WHAT ITS PURPOSE ACTUALLY WAS.THE ENACTMENT OF 1107 WAS SIMPLY A CODIFICATION OF AN OPINION OF THE COURT OF APPEALS IN PEOPLE VERSUS ARIS, 215 CAL. APP. 3D, A 1989 DECISION IN WHICH THE VICTIM OF A BATTERING RELATIONSHIP WAS ACCUSED OF MURDERING HER HUSBAND WHILE HE SLEPT, SHOOTING HIM IN THE BACK WHILE HE SLEPT IN HIS BED.AND AT THAT TRIAL, THE PROSECUTION PRESENTED THE TESTIMONY OF DR. LENORE WALKER, A LEADING EXPERT WHO ACTUALLY DEVELOPED THE BATTERED WOMAN'S SYNDROME.AND WHAT THEY PROPOSE TO DO WITH DR. WALKER'S TESTIMONY IS TO SHOW, TO BOLSTER A CLAIM OF SELF-DEFENSE, WHY THE VICTIM OF A BATTERING RELATIONSHIP WOULD HAVE REASONABLE FEAR OF THE PERSON WHO BATTERED HERE EVEN WHILE HE SLEPT AND WHY IT MIGHT BE REASONABLE FOR SUCH A PERSON TO SHOOT THAT BATTERER RATHER THAN JUST TO WALK AWAY FROM THE RELATIONSHIP.AND WHAT THE COURT HELD IN ARIS WAS THAT DR. WALKER WAS PROPERLY PROHIBITED FROM STATING AN OPINION THAT THE DEFENDANT ACTUALLY PERCEIVED THAT SHE WAS IN EMINENT DANGER AND NEEDED TO KILL IN SELF-DEFENSE.BUT THE ARIS COURT SAID IT WAS NOT ERROR TO PERMIT DR. WALKER TO TESTIFY BASED ON HER EXPERIENCE AND THE BATTERED WOMAN'S SYNDROME THEORY AS TO HOW THE DEFENDANT'S PARTICULAR EXPERIENCES AS A BATTERED WOMAN AFFECTED HER PERCEPTIONS OF DANGER, ITS IMMINENCE AND WHAT ACTIONS WERE NECESSARY TO PROTECT HERSELF.NOW, WHAT THE LEGISLATURE DID IN ENACTING 1107 IS TO CODIFY THE RULING IN PEOPLE VERSUS ARIS THAT THE EXPERT SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO OFFER TESTIMONY WITH RESPECT TO THE IMPACT OF BATTERING UPON THAT VICTIM'S PERCEPTION OF IMMINENCE OF DANGER AND WHAT DANGERS OR WHAT ACTIONS ARE NECESSARY TO PROTECT HERSELF. IT ALSO ABROGATED THE HOLDING OF ARIS BY SAYING THAT --

#MR. UELMEN: ,"IT ABROGATED ARIS BY SAYING THAT THE TESTIMONY OF AN OPINION AS TO WHETHER THE DEFENDANT ACTUALLY PERCEIVED SHE WAS IN EMINENT DANGER COULD BE ADMITTED.SO TO THAT EXTENT, THE LEGISLATURE WENT BEYOND ARIS.BUT IN ONE RESPECT, THE LEGISLATURE WAS VERY CAREFUL TO RETAIN THE LIMITATIONS RECOGNIZED BY THE ARIS OPINION ITSELF WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF SUCH EVIDENCE AGAINST A CRIMINAL DEFENDANT WHO WAS ACCUSED OF BEING THE BATTERER AND OFFERING IT TO SHOW THAT IT'S MORE LIKELY HE COMMITTED THE CRIME AGAINST THE VICTIM OF THE BATTERING RELATIONSHIP.IN ARIS, THE COURT SPECIFICALLY REFERRED TO PRIOR OPINIONS BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT IN BLEDSOE AND BY THE CALIFORNIA COURT OF APPEAL IN BALKER.AND I THINK THAT'S A PARTICULARLY PROPORTION OF BOTH THE ARIS OPINION AND THE SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATION BECAUSE THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY MAKES IT QUITE CLEAR THAT THE LEGISLATURE WAS AWARE OF BLEDSOE AND BALKER AND INTENDED TO CONTINUE THE PROHIBITIONS CONTAINED IN THOSE CASES OF THE USE OF EXPERT TESTIMONY IN THE FORM THAT THE PROSECUTION PROPOSES TO PRESENT IT IN THIS CASE.IN ARIS, THE COURT SAID:""THE RESPONDENT CONTENDS THAT DR. WALKER'S PROFFERED OPINION TESTIMONY THAT DEFENDANT WAS SUFFERING FROM BATTERED WOMAN'S SYNDROME SHOULD BE ANALOGIZED TO THE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE ACCOMMODATION SYNDROME AND THE RAPE TRAUMA SYNDROME THAT WAS EXCLUDED UNDER AUTHORITY OF PEOPLE VERSUS BLEDSOE AND PEOPLE VERSUS BALKER.""AND THE COURT IN ARIS RECOGNIZED THAT BOTH BLEDSOE AND BALKER DEALT WITH OPINIONS THAT A RAPE OR A CHILD ABUSE VICTIM'S BEHAVIOR WERE EVIDENCE THAT THE VICTIM HAD ACTUALLY BEEN RAPED OR ABUSED, AND THE COURTS IN THOSE CASES HELD THAT THESE OPINIONS WERE INADMISSIBLE BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT SATISFY THE KELLY-FRYE TEST AND THEY COULDN'T SATISFY THE KELLY-FRYE TEST BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH CHILD ABUSE ACCOMMODATION SYNDROME AND RAPE TRAUMA SYNDROME ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, THEY ARE NOT ACCEPTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROVING THAT A CRIME OCCURRED.THAT'S NOT THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THE SYNDROMES WERE DEVELOPED AND IT'S NOT THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THEY CAN BE OFFERED IN EVIDENCE AT A TRIAL.AND IF YOUR HONOR GOES BACK TO THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT OPINION IN BLEDSOE, THEY COULD NOT HAVE SAID IT MORE CLEARLY.READING FROM THE OPINION IN THE BLEDSOE CASE:""GIVEN THE HISTORY, THE PURPOSE AND NATURE OF THE RAPE TRAUMA SYNDROME, WE CONCLUDE THAT EXPERT TESTIMONY THAT A COMPLAINING WITNESS SUFFERS FROM RAPE TRAUMA SYNDROME IS NOT ADMISSIBLE TO PROVE THAT THE WITNESS WAS RAPED.""WE EMPHASIZE OUR CONCLUSION IN THIS REGARD IS NOT INTENDED TO SUGGEST THAT RAPE TRAUMA SYNDROME IS NOT GENERALLY RECOGNIZED OR USED IN THE GENERAL SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, BUT ONLY THAT IT IS NOT RELIED ON IN THAT COMMUNITY FOR THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THE PROSECUTION SOUGHT TO USE IT IN THIS CASE; NAMELY, TO PROVE THAT A RAPE IN FACT OCCURRED.""BECAUSE THE LITERATURE DOES NOT EVEN PURPORT TO CLAIM THAT THE SYNDROME IS A SCIENTIFICALLY RELIABLE MEANS OF PROVING THAT A RAPE OCCURRED, WE CONCLUDE THAT IT MAY NOT PROPERLY BE USED FOR THAT PURPOSE IN A CRIMINAL TRIAL.""AND WE HAVE A PRECISELY ANALOGOUS SITUATION HERE. THE BATTERED WOMAN'S SYNDROME WAS NOT DEVELOPED TO PREDICT WHICH VICTIMS OF BATTERING ARE LIKELY TO SUBSEQUENTLY BECOME THE VICTIMS OF A HOMICIDE.THE STATISTICAL BASIS OF THE PREDICTION SIMPLY WOULDN'T SUPPORT THAT USE OF THE SYNDROME. EVEN USING THE MOST CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATES OF HOW MANY BATTERINGS OF WOMEN THERE ARE EVERY YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES, THAT NUMBER IS AROUND TWO MILLION.APPLYING THE MOST EXPANSIVE ESTIMATES OF HOW MANY HOMICIDES -- OF THE 22,000 HOMICIDES IN AMERICA EVERY YEAR, HOW MANY OF THOSE HOMICIDES ARE SPOUSAL ABUSE TYPE HOMICIDES, THE NUMBER RANGES SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 2,000 AND 4,000.SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF THE ACTUAL BATTERING INCIDENTS RESULTING IN A HOMICIDE IN A GIVEN YEAR.NOW, WHAT THE PROSECUTION PROPOSES TO DO IN THIS CASE IS TO WORK BACKWARDS. ASSUME THE IDENTITY OF THE PERPETRATOR. ASSUME THAT MR. SIMPSON WAS THE PERPETRATOR OF THIS MURDER. THEREFORE, NOW WE CAN LOOK BACKWARD AT THE PRIOR RELATIONSHIP, AND THAT BECOMES RELEVANT TO EXPLAIN HIS BEHAVIOR WITH RESPECT TO THIS INCIDENT.BUT OF COURSE, HERE THE IDENTITY OF THE PERPETRATOR IS WHAT IS AT ISSUE IN THIS CASE. AND WHAT THE PROSECUTION REALLY WANTS TO DO IS TO SAY BASED ON AN EXPERT'S ANALYSIS OF THIS PRIOR RELATIONSHIP FOR A 17-YEAR PERIOD, WE CAN PREDICT THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT MR. SIMPSON WAS THE PERPETRATOR OF THIS MURDER ON JUNE 12TH.THE SCIENCE DOESN'T SUPPORT THAT, THE BATTERED WOMAN'S SYNDROME WAS NOT DEVELOPED TO SUPPORT THAT AND THAT IS THE PRECISE USE OF THE BATTERED WOMAN'S SYNDROME THAT IS PROHIBITED BY SECTION 1107 OF THE EVIDENCE CODE.SO WE WILL CONTEND OF COURSE THAT NOT ONLY ARE THESE INDIVIDUAL INCIDENTS IRRELEVANT WITH RESPECT TO PROVING THE OFFENSE CHARGED ON JUNE 12TH, BUT THE ADMISSION OF ANY EXPERT TESTIMONY TO ATTEMPT TO INTERPRET THESE INCIDENTS AND PRESENT SOME OPINION TO THE JURY BASED UPON THEM WOULD BE HIGHLY IMPROPER AND IN DIRECT CONTRAVENTION OF SECTION 1107 AS WELL AS OF THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT RULING IN BLEDSOE AND THE COURT OF APPEAL OPINION IN BALKER DEALING WITH THE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE ACCOMMODATION SYNDROME.THE FINAL GENERAL ISSUE THAT WE WANTED TO ADDRESS BEFORE MOVING INTO THE INDIVIDUAL INCIDENTS RELATES TO THE PROHIBITION OF HEARSAY TESTIMONY. AND OF COURSE, THE HEARSAY RULE IS ALSO DESIGNED TO PROTECT A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT OF ANY CRIMINAL ACCUSED; AND THAT IS THE RIGHT TO CONFRONT AND TO CROSS-EXAMINE THE WITNESSES AGAINST HIM.NOW, YOUR HONOR IS WELL AWARE OF COURSE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF EXCEPTIONS TO THE HEARSAY RULE, EXCEPTIONS BASED UPON CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SHOW THAT THE OUT-OF-COURT STATEMENT IS SO RELIABLE THAT WE DON'T NEED TO CROSS-EXAMINE THE DECLARANT IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE RELIABILITY OF OR THE ACCURACY OF THAT STATEMENT.NOW, WITH RESPECT TO MOST OF THE ITEMS, AS YOU GO THROUGH THE LIST OF ALL OF THE ITEMS THAT ARE IN ISSUE, NO EXCEPTION TO THE HEARSAY RULE HAS EVEN BEEN SUGGESTED THAT WOULD MAKE ANY OF THESE STATEMENTS, OUT-OF-COURT STATEMENTS ADMISSIBLE AS AN EXCEPTION TO THE HEARSAY RULE.I REFER SPECIFICALLY TO ALL OF THE INCIDENTS THAT WERE DERIVED FROM A DOCUMENT THAT THE PROSECUTION HAS CALLED A DIARY, WHICH IS FAR FROM A DIARY. WHAT IT IS IS A MEMO PREPARED FOR THE DIVORCE LAWYER REPRESENTING MRS. SIMPSON IN THE DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS LEADING TO THE DISSOLUTION OF HER MARRIAGE WITH MR. SIMPSON.AND WHAT MRS. SIMPSON WAS ASKED TO DO, AS MANY PARTIES ARE TO THESE TYPES OF PROCEEDINGS, IS TO SIT DOWN AND JUST MAKE UP A LIST OF EVERYTHING THAT SHE COULD RECALL THAT SHE THOUGHT MIGHT BE USABLE TO OBTAIN SOME ADVANTAGE IN THAT DIVORCE PROCEEDING.THESE KINDS OF DOCUMENTS ARE NOTORIOUSLY UNRELIABLE. THEY ARE PREPARED WITH A MOTIVE TO EXAGGERATE. THEY ARE PREPARED IN ORDER TO GAIN SOME ADVANTAGE IN PENDING LITIGATION. THEY ARE NOT PROOF OF ANY STATE OF MIND OTHER THAN THE STATE OF MIND THAT ACCOMPANIES THE LITIGATION FOR WHICH THEY ARE PREPARED.SO THERE'S SIMPLY NO EXCEPTION TO THE HEARSAY RULE THAT WOULD PERMIT A DOCUMENT OF THIS NATURE TO BE BROUGHT INTO COURT TO PROVE THE TRUTH OF THE ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN THAT DOCUMENT WITHOUT CROSS-EXAMINATION OF THE DECLARANT.SO UNTIL THE PEOPLE CAN AT LEAST PRESENT SOME PLAUSIBLE THEORY OF AN EXCEPTION THAT WOULD JUSTIFY THE USE OF THIS EVIDENCE, I THINK YOUR HONOR CAN MAKE SHORT SHRIFT OF ANY INCIDENTS OR ISSUES WHERE THE ONLY PROOF OF THEM IS GOING TO COME IN THE NATURE OF THAT KIND OF DOCUMENT WHICH WILL BE READILY EXCLUDABLE AS HEARSAY.THE TWO EXCEPTIONS THAT THE PROSECUTION HAS PRESENTED WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF THE EVIDENCE THEY PROPOSE TO PRESENT IS THAT THE EVIDENCE WAS A SPONTANEOUS STATEMENT MADE UNDER THE EXCITEMENT OF PERCEIVED CIRCUMSTANCES AND THAT THE OUT-OF-COURT STATEMENTS WILL BE ADMISSIBLE TO SHOW THE STATE OF MIND OF THE DECLARANT.NOW, ONCE AGAIN, I THINK IF YOUR HONOR ADDRESSES THE QUESTION OF WHAT IS REALLY AT ISSUE IN THIS CASE, WE CAN CUT THROUGH A LOT OF THIS EVIDENCE AND SIMPLY RESOLVE IT BY RECOGNIZING THAT THERE IS NO ISSUE IN THIS CASE AS TO THE STATE OF MIND OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON OR THE STATE OF MIND OF RONALD GOLDMAN FOR THAT MATTER.THERE ARE NO FACTUAL ISSUES RELATED TO ANY OF THEIR CONDUCT ON THE -- AT THE TIME THAT THE KILLING OCCURRED. THERE IS NO NEED TO EXPLAIN ANYTHING THEY DID OR DIDN'T DO AT THE TIME THEY BECAME VICTIMS OF THIS HOMICIDE. IT'S SIMPLY NOT AN ISSUE IN THE CASE.AND HERE, THERE ARE TWO VERY RECENT CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT OPINIONS DIRECTLY ON POINT ON WHICH THE DEFENSE WILL RELY. BOTH INVOLVE VICTIMS WHO EXPRESSED FEARS OF THE DEFENDANT ACCUSED OF THEIR MURDER TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS. AND IN BOTH OF THESE CASES, THE COURT HELD THERE WAS NO HEARSAY EXCEPTION THAT JUSTIFIED THE ADMISSION OF THIS EVIDENCE AND ITS ADMISSION WAS REVERSIBLE ERROR.THE FIRST OF THESE CASES IS PEOPLE VERSUS IRELAND, 70 CAL. 2D 529, IN WHICH THE -- AND THIS IS A CASE OF A SPOUSAL MURDER, A HUSBAND ACCUSED OF MURDERING HIS WIFE.THE PROSECUTION CALLED AS A WITNESS A FAMILY FRIEND WHO HAD KNOWN THE DEFENDANT FOR 11 YEARS WHO TESTIFIED THAT THE WITNESS HAD VISITED HER, AND THE PROSECUTION ASKED HER THE SUBSTANCE OF A TELEPHONE CONVERSATION SHE HAD WITH THE VICTIM IN WHICH THE VICTIM ALLEGEDLY SAID -- AND THIS WAS ON THE VERY MORNING THAT THE MURDER OCCURRED.""I KNOW HE'S GOING TO KILL ME. I WISH HE WOULD HURRY UP AND GET IT OVER WITH. HE'LL NEVER LET ME LEAVE.""THE VERY MORNING THAT THE VICTIM WAS MURDERED, THOSE FEARS WERE EXPRESSED TO A CLOSE FAMILY FRIEND.AND THE PROSECUTION'S THEORY WAS THE SAME THEORY OFFERED HERE; THAT IT WAS RELEVANT TO SHOW THE STATE OF MIND OF THE VICTIM.AND THE COURT SAID, SUCH STATE OF MIND SIMPLY WASN'T RELEVANT, IT WAS NOT AN ISSUE IN THE CASE IN TERMS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE MURDER THAT OCCURRED.IT IS CLEAR AT THE OUTSET THE COURT SAID THAT THE DECLARANT'S, ANN'S, STATE OF MIND ON THE DAY OF THE DEATH WAS NOT ITSELF AN ISSUE IN THE CASE. THE DEFENSE DID NOT RAISE ANY ISSUE OF FACT WITH RESPECT TO ANN'S CONDUCT IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING HER DEATH. THEREFORE, THE EVIDENCE WAS INADMISSIBLE.THE IRELAND CASE WAS FOLLOWED IN THE SUBSEQUENT DECISION OF THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT IN PEOPLE VERSUS ARCEGA, A 1982 OPINION, IN WHICH THE PROSECUTION ASKED THE VICTIM'S MOTHER WHETHER THE VICTIM HAD EVER EXPRESSED FEAR OF THE DEFENDANT.THE OBJECTION WAS MADE THAT THIS WAS HEARSAY. THE OBJECTION WAS OVERRULED, AND THE MOTHER THEN TESTIFIED THAT SHORTLY BEFORE HER DEATH, THE APPELLATE TOLD HER THAT THE DEFENDANT -- OR THE VICTIM TOLD HER THAT THE DEFENDANT WAS TREATING HER WEIRD BY FOLLOWING HER CLOSELY AROUND THE APARTMENT. THE VICTIM EXPRESSED TO HER MOTHER THE FEAR THAT THE DEFENDANT WAS GOING TO HIT HER, TO BEAT HER UP.AND AGAIN, THE THEORY OFFERED FOR THAT WAS THE SAME THEORY OFFERED HERE; THAT THIS EVIDENCE WAS TO SHOW THE STATE OF MIND OF THE VICTIM.AND THE COURT, CITING PEOPLE VERSUS IRELAND, CONCLUDED THAT THE VICTIM'S STATE OF MIND WAS NOT AN ISSUE IN THE CASE. THEREFORE, IT WAS ERROR AND IT WAS REVERSIBLE ERROR TO ADMIT THAT EVIDENCE.THE COURT CONCLUDED IN THE PRESENT CASE, AS IN IRELAND:""THE ACTS OR CONDUCT OF THE DECLARANT IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE HOMICIDE WERE SIMPLY NOT IN DISPUTE.""THE DEFENSE DID NOT QUESTION PROSECUTION EVIDENCE WHICH INDICATED THAT THE VICTIM WAS LYING ON HER BED AT THE TIME OF THE KILLING. THEREFORE, ADMISSION OF THE HEARSAY STATEMENTS REGARDING MILNER'S FEAR OF THE APPELLATE AND HIS WEIRD ACTIONS WAS ERROR.""AND THAT IS PRECISELY THE SITUATION THAT WILL BE PRESENTED IN THIS CASE. THE DEFENSE WILL NOT OFFER ANY EVIDENCE OR MAKE ANY ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO THE STATE OF MIND OF EITHER OF THESE VICTIMS AT THE TIME THEY WERE KILLED. SO THIS EVIDENCE SIMPLY WILL NOT BE RELEVANT TO ANY ISSUE IN THIS CASE.THAT --IF I COULD JUST HAVE A MOMENT.

#MR. UELMEN: ,"THE CHRONOLOGY BEGINS WITH 1977. AND OF COURSE, I THINK THAT RIGHT AT THE OUTSET RAISES THE WHOLE ISSUE OF REMOTENESS, OF HOW FAR ARE WE GOING TO GO BACK IN TERMS OF THE ALLOWANCE OF EVIDENCE OF THIS NATURE IN TERMS OF THE POLICIES THAT WE OUTLINED OF PUTTING MR. SIMPSON IN THE DEFENSE OF HAVING TO DEFEND AGAINST UNCHARGED CONDUCT, OF THE RISK OF PREJUDICE OF THIS MATERIAL IN TERMS OF ITS VERY LIMITED RELEVANCE BEING GIVEN MORE WEIGHT THAN IT TRULY DESERVES.BUT I THINK ITEMS 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 AND 6 ALL COME DIRECTLY FROM THIS DOCUMENT THAT I JUST REFERRED TO THAT THE PEOPLE ARE CALLING A DIARY, WHICH REALLY ISN'T A DIARY, THIS MEMO THAT WAS PREPARED IN ORDER FOR -- TO ASSIST THE LAWYER REPRESENTING MRS. SIMPSON IN THE DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS.SO THERE IS NO SOURCE PER PEOPLE'S WITNESSES FOR ANY OF THESE SIX ALLEGED INCIDENTS. THEY ARE ALL ALLEGATIONS THAT COME DIRECTLY FROM THE MEMORANDUM PREPARED BY THE VICTIM, WHO IS OF COURSE UNAVAILABLE FOR CROSS-EXAMINATION.SO I BELIEVE THE HEARSAY OBJECTION SHOULD DISPOSE OF ALL SIX OF THESE ITEMS. AND WE'RE STILL WAITING TO HEAR ANY PLAUSIBLE THEORY OF ANY EXCEPTION TO THE HEARSAY RULE WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE ADMISSION OF ANY OF THIS EVIDENCE.ITEM 7, THIS COMES FROM THE PROSECUTION RESPONSE SIMPLY SUMMARIZING EVIDENCE THAT THEY BELIEVE THEY CAN PRESENT THROUGH DENISE BROWN AND ED MC CABE THAT SOMETIME IN 1982 -- AND AGAIN, WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THIS OCCURRED -- THE DEFENDANT GRABBED THE VICTIM'S CLOTHES, BROKE SOME PICTURES AND THREW THEM OUT OF THE HOUSE.AGAIN, OF COURSE, THE DIFFICULTY OF DEFENDING AGAINST THIS ALLEGATION IS COMPOUNDED BY THE LACK OF ANY DATE OR EVEN APPROXIMATE DATE WHEN THIS OCCURRED. AND AS WITH ALL OF THESE INCIDENTS, I THINK WE NEED TO ASK OURSELVES HOW SIMILAR IS THIS TO WHAT HAPPENED ON JUNE 12TH, 1994.I MEAN HOW DOES -- I MEAN EVEN IF WE ASSUME THIS TOOK PLACE AS DESCRIBED IN THE PEOPLE'S MOVING PAPERS, THAT IN THE COURSE OF AN ARGUMENT IN 1982, 12 YEARS BEFORE THIS MURDER TOOK PLACE, THAT THEY GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT AND HE THREW HER OUT OF THE HOUSE WITH HER CLOTHES, WHAT DOES THAT SHOW IN TERMS OF THE MOTIVE, INTENT OR IDENTITY OF THE PERPETRATOR OF THIS MURDER IN 1994?WE WOULD CONCLUDE THAT SECTION 1101(B) IS NOT SERVED BY THIS EVIDENCE AND THE POTENTIAL FOR PREJUDICE FAR OUTWEIGHS ANY PROBATIVE VALUE THAT IT WOULD HAVE.ITEM NUMBER 8 PRESENTS A VERY AMBIGUOUS STATEMENT BY -- ATTRIBUTED TO A FORMER MAID WHO WAS EMPLOYED AT THE SIMPSON RESIDENCE WHO SIMPLY DESCRIBED AT SOME POINT IN 1984 OR 1985 -- AGAIN, WE HAVE NO PRECISE DATE IN TERMS OF DEFENDING AGAINST THIS CHARGE -- SHE SAW MRS. SIMPSON OUTSIDE THE HOUSE. THERE WAS NO STATEMENT MADE AS TO WHAT HAD HAPPENED. SHE WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND SAW A BUNCH OF BROKEN PICTURES ON THE FLOOR.WHAT INFERENCE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DERIVE FROM THAT AND HOW THAT IS EVEN RELEVANT TO WHAT HAPPENED ON JUNE 12TH, 1994 IS LEFT TO OUR IMAGINATION.I MEAN EVEN IF WE INFER THAT IN A MOMENT OF ANGER 10 YEARS BEFORE, MR. SIMPSON BROKE SOME PICTURE FRAMES, WHAT DOES THAT TELL US IN TERMS OF ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED IN 1994?NUMBER 9 AND NUMBER 14 ARE CLOSELY RELATED IN THE SENSE THAT THE PERCIPIENT WITNESS WITH RESPECT TO THIS INCIDENT IS LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT DETECTIVE MARK FUHRMAN. THERE IS NO CONTEMPORANEOUS POLICE REPORT WITH RESPECT TO THIS INCIDENT. IN FACT, WE ARE UNAWARE OF ANY CONTEMPORANEOUS ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS ALLEGED INCIDENT AT ALL.WHAT WE HAVE IS A 1989 LETTER IN WHICH DETECTIVE FUHRMAN CLAIMS TO HAVE A VERY DETAILED MEMORY OF WHAT WAS SAID AND WHAT TOOK PLACE. AND THAT LETTER SUGGESTS THAT WHAT HE ENCOUNTERED WAS AN ARGUMENT RELATED TO DAMAGE DONE TO MRS. SIMPSON'S AUTOMOBILE BY MR. SIMPSON.AGAIN, WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THIS TOOK PLACE. IT MAY HAVE BEEN EVEN BEFORE MR. AND MRS. SIMPSON WERE ACTUALLY MARRIED. THE ALLEGATION IS THAT MR. SIMPSON TOOK A BASEBALL BAT AND DAMAGED MRS. SIMPSON'S AUTOMOBILE.AND THE CONCERN SHE EXPRESSED WAS, WHO WAS GOING TO PAY FOR FIXING UP HER CAR. THERE WAS NO PHYSICAL ASSAULT. THERE'S NOT ANY ALLEGATION OF ANY PHYSICAL ASSAULT. IT IS SIMPLY AN ARGUMENT ABOUT WHO IS GOING TO REPAIR A CAR.ONCE AGAIN, WHAT DOES THIS TELL US OR HOW DOES THIS ASSIST THE JURY IN DETERMINING WHAT TOOK PLACE ON JUNE 12TH, 1994? WHERE IS ANY SIMILARITY TO ANY OF THE EVIDENCE SURROUNDING THE EVENTS OF JUNE 12TH, 1994?AND OF COURSE, THE DANGER OR THE RISK OF PREJUDICE OF THIS BEING USED SIMPLY TO COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT MR. SIMPSON HAS A BAD TEMPER OR MR. SIMPSON IS A BAD MAN; THEREFORE, IT'S MORE LIKELY HE COMMITTED THIS CRIME IS A VERY GRAVE ONE IN THE CONTEXT OF AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS, ESPECIALLY AN INCIDENT AS MUCH AS 10 YEARS OLD.ITEM NUMBER 10 ON YOUR HONOR'S LIST REFERS TO -- EXCUSE ME.BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICTATTORNEY AND DEFENSE COUNSEL.)
","JANUARY 11, 1995 ",9:05 A.M.
#MR. UELMEN: ,"ITEM NUMBER 10 REFERS TO AN INCIDENT ALLEGEDLY TAKING PLACE IN SEPTEMBER OF 1986 IN WHICH MRS. SIMPSON WAS TREATED AT A HOSPITAL FOR INJURIES RELATED TO A BICYCLE ACCIDENT.AND THE PEOPLE HAVE REFERRED TO THE TESTIMONY OF A DR. MARTIN ALPERT, WHO THEY PROPOSE TO PRESENT TO EXPRESS SOME RESERVATIONS HE HAD AS TO WHETHER IN FACT THE INJURIES WERE OBTAINED IN THAT MANNER.THE DIFFICULTY OF COURSE WITH THIS -- AND THIS IS GOING TO PRESENT A VERY SUBSTANTIAL 402, 403 QUESTION FOR THE COURT TO RESOLVE BEFORE THIS EVIDENCE IS PRESENTED TO A JURY WITH RESPECT TO WHETHER ANY INFERENCE CAN BE DRAWN FROM THE OPINION OF DR. ALPERT APPARENTLY BASED ON HIS RECOLLECTION OF WHAT HAPPENED NINE YEARS AGO.THE MEDICAL RECORDS AND X-RAYS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED. THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF COURSE OFFER NO ILLUMINATION OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED PRECEDING THESE INJURIES. THERE IS NO BASIS PRESENTED WHATSOEVER TO DOUBT THE ACCOUNT OF HOW THESE INJURIES ACTUALLY TOOK PLACE THAT WAS PRESENTED TO THE DOCTOR AT THE TIME THE TREATMENT TOOK PLACE.SO WITH RESPECT TO THAT INCIDENT OR ALLEGED INCIDENT, WE HAVE TWO PROBLEMS. FIRST IS A PROBLEM OF PROOF IN TERMS OF HOW ANY INFERENCE THAT THE PEOPLE WANT TO DRAW FROM THIS EVIDENCE WILL BE JUSTIFIED BY THE EVIDENCE THEY PROPOSE TO PRESENT; AND SECONDLY, EVEN IF THAT INFERENCE IS JUSTIFIED, WHAT IT PROVES IN TERMS OF THE EVENTS THAT TOOK PLACE ON JUNE 12TH, 1994.IF ALL IT PROVES IS THAT SOME EFFORT WAS MADE TO CONCEAL THE TRUE NATURE OF INJURIES THAT WERE SUSTAINED BY MRS. SIMPSON IN 1986, WHAT DOES THAT PROVE IN TERMS OF WHAT TOOK PLACE IN 1994?IT DOESN'T SHOW THE IDENTITY. IT DOESN'T SHOW ANY MOTIVE. IT DOESN'T KNOW ANY INTENT WITH RESPECT TO THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENED IN 1994.NOW, I MAY HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS TO RAISE ABOUT THESE ALLEGATIONS AFTER I'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONFER WITH COCOUNSEL. BUT I'LL KEEP GOING SO WE CAN GET THROUGH AS MUCH AS WE CAN BEFORE THE LUNCHEON RECESS.INCIDENTS 11 AND 12 AGAIN ARE RANK HEARSAY. THE ONLY SOURCE OF ANY INFORMATION ABOUT EITHER OF THESE ALLEGATIONS COMES FROM THAT SUPPOSED DIARY. AND AGAIN, NO PLAUSIBLE THEORY OF ANY EXCEPTION TO THE HEARSAY RULE HAS BEEN PRESENTED BY THE PEOPLE.WITH RESPECT TO ITEM NUMBER 13, THIS OF COURSE IS THE ONE INCIDENT THAT ACTUALLY WAS BROUGHT TO COURT AND RESULTED IN A CRIMINAL CONVICTION OF THE DEFENDANT BASED ON HIS PLEA OF NO CONTEST TO A CHARGE OF ASSAULTING MRS. SIMPSON.AND WITH RESPECT TO THIS INCIDENT, WE HAVE POLICE REPORTS, WE HAVE ACCOUNTS IN THE FORM OF LETTERS OF EXPLANATION WRITTEN BY THE DEFENDANT HIMSELF, INTERVIEWS AND A GOOD DEAL OF INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT ACTUALLY TOOK PLACE.AND WHAT APPARENTLY TOOK PLACE WAS THAT AT THE CONCLUSION OF A NEW YEAR'S CELEBRATION IN WHICH BOTH MR. SIMPSON AND NICOLE SIMPSON HAD A LOT TO DRINK, THEY GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT IN THEIR BEDROOM. AND THE CULMINATION OF THAT ARGUMENT WAS A PHYSICAL ASSAULT IN WHICH MR. SIMPSON ADMITTED THAT HE SLAPPED AND PUNCHED NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON.SHE THEN CALLED THE POLICE. THERE WAS A POLICE INTERVENTION, AND THE CULMINATION OF THAT INTERVENTION WAS THE FILING OF A CHARGE TO WHICH MR. SIMPSON ENTERED A NO CONTEST. HE WAS PLACED ON PROBATION ON THE CONDITION THAT HE UNDERGO COUNSELING. HE FULFILLED ALL OF THE CONDITIONS OF THAT PROBATION.AND HERE, ONCE AGAIN, WE SIMPLY ASK, WHAT'S THE RELEVANCE OF THAT IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENED ON JUNE 12TH, 1994?WHERE IS THERE ANY SIMILARITY BETWEEN A BEDROOM ARGUMENT IN WHICH BOTH PARTIES HAD BEEN DRINKING AND THE ARGUMENT ESCALATES INTO A SLAPPING INCIDENT AND THE SLASHING OF TWO PEOPLE'S THROATS ON A SIDEWALK ON JUNE 12TH, 1994?HOW CAN WE DRAW ANY INFERENCE THAT BOTH OF THESE INCIDENTS WERE DONE OR BOTH OF THESE EVENTS WERE DONE WITH THE SAME INTENT, WITH THE SAME MOTIVE OR BY THE SAME PERSON?WHERE IS THERE ANY RELEVANCE IN TERMS OF ASSISTING THE JURY IN DETERMINING WHO KILLED NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, WHO KILLED RONALD GOLDMAN TO KNOW THAT FIVE YEARS BEFORE, AFTER A NEW YEAR'S PARTY, MR. SIMPSON AND HIS WIFE GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT?IT SIMPLY DOES NOTHING IN TERMS OF THE TASK THAT FACES THIS JURY WHILE THE RISK OF PREJUDICE IS OVERWHELMING. THE RISK THAT THEY WILL DRAW IS SIMPLY AN INFERENCE OF BAD CHARACTER, BAD TEMPER AND ASSUME BASED ON THAT INFERENCE THAT IT'S MORE LIKELY THAT MR. SIMPSON IS THE PERPETRATOR OF THIS MURDER. AND FOR THAT PURPOSE, WE WOULD CONTEND IT SIMPLY HAS NO RELEVANCE WHATSOEVER.ITEM NUMBER 15, THE WRITING OF A LETTER RELATING TO THE PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT, AGAIN, WE'RE NOT AWARE OF WHAT RELEVANCE THAT WOULD HAVE ALTHOUGH IT WOULD COME WITHIN A HEARSAY EXCEPTION SINCE IT WAS WRITTEN BY THE DEFENDANT.BUT WHAT DOES IT PROVE? WHAT DOES IT PROVE IN TERMS OF WHAT TOOK PLACE IN 1994?ITEM NUMBER 16, THE -- AGAIN, SIMPLY A STATEMENT BY THE VICTIM TO SOME THIRD PERSON WHICH IS HEARSAY. NO HEARSAY SUGGESTION IS SUGGESTED.CERTAINLY THE VICTIM'S STATE OF MIND IN 1989 IS NOT RELEVANT TO ANY QUESTION WITH RESPECT TO EVENTS TAKING PLACE FIVE YEARS LATER. AND EVEN, AS WE'VE ALREADY ARGUED, STATE OF MIND FIVE YEARS LATER IS IRRELEVANT, THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AN ISSUE IN THIS CASE.

ACOSTA'S STATEMENT, THEY HAD BEEN DRINKING, AND WHILE HE IS DRIVING THE CAR ALONG, ALLEGEDLY, HE BELIEVES THAT MR. SIMPSON HIT MR. -- MRS. SIMPSON IN THE BACK OF THE LIMOUSINE.NOW, WHAT DOES THAT DO FOR US IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENED IN JUNE OF 1994? WHAT DOES THAT TELL US? WHAT DOES THAT TELL US ABOUT ANY OF THE RELEVANT FACTS THAT WE ARE STRUGGLING WITH IN THIS CASE?AND TO SAY TO MR. SIMPSON AT THIS POINT IN THESE PROCEEDINGS COME UP WITH SOME SORT OF EXPLANATION OR DEFENSE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE BACK OF AN AUTOMOBILE EIGHT -- SEVEN, EIGHT YEARS AGO, AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO TELL YOU WHEN IT HAPPENED, IS AN INSURMOUNTABLE TASK FACING THE DEFENSE, AND I JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE THE EXTENT TO WHICH MUCH OF WHAT IS IN THIS CHRONOLOGY IS OF THE SAME NATURE.ITEM 18. HERE WE ARE TOLD OF AN INCIDENT OF WHAT IS DESCRIBED AS VERBAL ABUSE IN A BAR.AND THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT VERBAL ABUSE. VERBAL ABUSE IS A NICE EUPHEMISM FOR AN ARGUMENT, AND TO SAY THAT EVERY TIME A MARRIED COUPLE GETS INTO AN ARGUMENT, THAT IS ABUSE OR VERBAL ABUSE, BECAUSE THEY HURL CRUEL WORDS AT EACH OTHER AND THAT SOMEHOW BECOMES RELEVANT TO PROVE SOMETHING IN A SUBSEQUENT CRIMINAL CASE, RAISES A SUBSTANTIAL QUESTION FOR THE COURT.AND THE QUESTION IS NOT JUST IN THE CONTEXT OF THE DICTA IN PEOPLE VERSUS ZACK WHICH SAYS ONLY PHYSICAL ASSAULTS BECOME ADMISSIBLE EVEN UNDER THE BROADEST CONCEPTION OF THE RULE IMAGINABLE, BUT IT ALSO IS RELEVANT BECAUSE ABUSE IS DEFINED AND IT IS DEFINED WITHIN THE EVIDENCE CODE. SECTION 1107 USES THE WORD ""ABUSE,"" AND IT SAYS:""WHEN WE USE THE WORD 'ABUSE' WE WANT IT TO HAVE THE SAME MEANING AS SECTION 6203 OF THE FAMILY CODE.""AND HERE IS HOW SECTION 6203 OF THE FAMILY CODE DEFINES ABUSE. IT SAYS:""'ABUSE' MEANS INTENTIONALLY OR RECKLESSLY TO CAUSE OR ATTEMPT TO CAUSE BODILY INJURY OR SEXUAL ASSAULT OR TO PLACE A PERSON IN REASONABLE APPREHENSION OF IMMINENT SERIOUS BODILY INJURY TO THAT PERSON OR TO ANOTHER.""SO THERE IS THE DEFINITION, THE LEGAL DEFINITION OF ABUSE THAT IS INCORPORATED IN THE EVIDENCE CODE, AND IT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT VERBAL ABUSE OR ARGUMENTS IN TERMS OF THEIR BEING CHARACTERIZED AS ABUSE, MUCH LESS IN TERMS OF THEIR BEING RELEVANT TO PROVE ANYTHING THAT IS GOING TO BE DISPUTED IN THIS CASE.THIS INCIDENT IN 1989, AGAIN WE ARE GIVEN AN INCIDENT WITHOUT ANY INDICATION OF WHEN IT TOOK PLACE, OTHER THAN WITHIN -- SOMETIME WITHIN A PERIOD OF A YEAR, APPARENTLY INVOLVED AN EVENT IN WHICH SIX DIFFERENT PEOPLE WERE GETTING IN AND OUT OF AN AUTOMOBILE, AND IF THIS IS GOING TO BE A REAL ISSUE THAT SOMEHOW AN ARGUMENT ABOUT WHO IS GOING TO DRIVE A CAR AND WHO IS GOING TO GET IN WHICH OF TWO DIFFERENT CARS PROVES SOMETHING ABOUT HOW THIS MURDER TOOK PLACE IN JUNE OF 1994, THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH TIME WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO SPEND IN THIS COURTROOM LITIGATING AMONG SIX DIFFERENT VERSIONS.AND I CAN ASSURE YOU, THERE WILL BE DIFFERENT VERSIONS FROM DIFFERENT WITNESSES OF WHAT TOOK PLACE IN TERMS OF WHO PUSHED WHO AND WHO GOT IN WHAT CAR AND WHO DROVE AWAY IN THAT CAR.AND THE QUESTION SIMPLY IS WHERE DOES THAT GET US? WHAT DOES IT PROVE IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENED ON JUNE 12, 1994?ITEM NO. 19 IS AGAIN A SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF RANK HEARSAY, OF SOMETHING THAT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON ALLEGEDLY SAID TO SOMEBODY ELSE IN 1991, AND AGAIN WE HAVE NO PLAUSIBLE EVEN SUGGESTION OF ANY HEARSAY EXCEPTION THAT WOULD MAKE THAT ADMISSIBLE IN THESE PROCEEDINGS.ITEM 20. ITEM 20, THE SOURCE IDENTIFIED IS EDDIE REYNOZA, AN ACTOR APPARENTLY WHO ALLEGES HE WAS ON A SET WITH MR. SIMPSON IN MAY OF 1991, AND THEY TALKED ABOUT CARS AND MR. SIMPSON ALLEGEDLY SAID THAT IF HE FOUND ANY OF HIS WIFE'S BOYFRIENDS DRIVING ONE OF HIS CARS HE WOULD CUT THEIR HEADS OFF -- CUT THEIR FUCKING HEADS OFF.OF COURSE THERE IS GOING TO BE A REAL CREDIBILITY ISSUE ABOUT WHETHER THAT WAS ACTUALLY SAID. MR. REYNOZA APPARENTLY IS ONE OF THOSE CHARACTERS ON THE FRINGES OF THIS CASE WHO IS ADVANCING HIS OWN FILM CAREER BY ASSIGNING HIMSELF A STARING ROLE IN THE CASE OF PEOPLE VERSUS O.J. SIMPSON, AND APPARENTLY HE HAS ATTEMPTED TO DO THIS IN OTHER CASES AS WELL, SO WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A REAL FIGHT ABOUT THE CREDIBILITY OF MR. REYNOZA.BUT BEFORE WE EVEN GET TO THAT FIGHT, I THINK WE HAVE GOT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF RELEVANCE.I MEAN, EVEN IF WE ASSUME THAT A STATEMENT OF THIS NATURE WAS MADE IN MAY OF 1991, THE FACT THAT MR. SIMPSON IS SAYING HE DOESN'T WANT BOYFRIENDS DRIVING HIS -- HIS WIFE'S CAR OR ONE OF HIS CARS, WHAT DOES THAT TELL US OR WHAT DOES THAT PROVE IN TERMS OF A MOTIVE FOR THIS MURDER?I MEAN, IS THE PROSECUTION SAYING THAT THE REASON THESE TWO PEOPLE WERE MURDERED WAS BECAUSE SOMEONE WAS DRIVING ONE OF MR. SIMPSON'S CARS? WHAT DOES IT TELL US ABOUT THE INTENT WITH WHICH THIS MURDER WAS COMMITTED OR THE IDENTITY OF THE PERPETRATOR? IT TELLS US ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.WHAT IT TELLS US IS IF WE WILL BELIEVE IT, MR. SIMPSON ON OCCASION WOULD USE THE WORD ""FUCK"" AND ON OTHER OCCASIONS HE WOULD GET ANGRY. IS THAT THE KIND OF EVIDENCE ON WHICH WE WANT THIS JURY TO MAKE A DETERMINATION OF WHETHER A MAN SHOULD BE CONVICTED OF MURDER?21. AGAIN THIS JUST -- WE'LL CONCEDE THAT.MR. SIMPSON AND HIS WIFE DID INITIATE DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS IN JANUARY OF 1992 AND WE MIGHT NOTE THAT IT WAS AN UNUSUALLY AMICABLE DIVORCE. THE DIARY THAT WE HAVE REFERRED TO THAT MRS. SIMPSON ALLEGEDLY WROTE OUT WAS NEVER USED. IT WAS NEVER OFFERED IN EVIDENCE IN THAT PROCEEDING. IN FACT, MRS. SIMPSON NEVER TESTIFIED IN THAT PROCEEDING. AN AGREEMENT WAS WORKED OUT. THERE WERE NEVER ANY RESTRAINING ORDERS.WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT WAS OBVIOUSLY A BUMPY MARRIAGE WITH SOME HIGH POINTS AND SOME LOW POINTS, I THINK IT IS QUITE REMARKABLE THAT IT WAS RESOLVED IN AS AMICABLE A WAY AS IT WAS.ITEM 22. AGAIN WE HAVE A NUMBER OF INCIDENTS THAT ALL TIE INTO THE TESTIMONY OF ONE WITNESS, AND THAT WITNESS IS KEITH ZLOMSOWITCH, AND THE EVIDENCE APPARENTLY IS GOING TO SHOW THAT IN EARLY 1992, WHILE THE DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS WERE GOING ON BETWEEN MR. SIMPSON AND HIS WIFE, SHE HAD AN AFFAIR WITH THIS MAN, KEITH ZLOMSOWITCH, WHO WAS THE MANAGER OF THE MEZZALUNA RESTAURANT AND WHOM SHE HAD MET IN ASPEN.AND THE KEY INCIDENT HERE IS NO. 24.IN APRIL OF 1992 THE PROSECUTION WILL CONTEND THAT MR. SIMPSON VISITED THE PREMISES WHERE MRS. SIMPSON WAS THEN RESIDING AND THROUGH THE FRONT WINDOW, FROM A VANTAGE POINT EQUALLY ACCESSIBLE TO ANYONE STANDING ON THE FRONT SIDEWALK, HE ACTUALLY OBSERVED MRS. SIMPSON AND MR. ZLOMSOWITCH ENGAGED IN SEXUAL ACTIVITY.AND WHAT HAPPENED? NOTHING. HE DID NOT INTERRUPT THEM. HE RETURNED TO THE PREMISES THE NEXT DAY, EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN ABOUT THIS ACTIVITY TAKING PLACE WHILE HIS CHILDREN WERE ASLEEP UPSTAIRS AND SUGGESTED THAT THAT KIND OF ACTIVITY WAS NOT APPROPRIATE IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS CHILDREN.HE ACTUALLY SHOOK HANDS WITH MR. ZLOMSOWITCH AND EXPRESSED NO HARD FEELINGS. WHAT IS THAT GOING TO PROVE? I MEAN, IF THE THEORY THAT THE PROSECUTION WANTS TO PRESENT WITH RESPECT TO THIS MURDER ON JUNE 12, 1994, WAS THAT THIS WAS SOME SORT OF ACT OF RAGE INVOLVING JEALOUSY, THEN THIS INCIDENT IN 1992 REALLY UNDERCUTS THAT THEORY. IN EFFECT IT SHOWS THAT MR. SIMPSON, EVEN OBSERVING HIS WIFE ENGAGED IN SEXUAL ACTIVITY WITH ANOTHER MAN, DID NOT BECOME BALLISTIC, DID NOT INTERRUPT THEM, DID NOT PHYSICALLY ASSAULT ANYONE.IN FACT, ALL OF THIS EVIDENCE WITH RESPECT TO ZLOMSOWITCH INVOLVES NO ALLEGATION OF ANY PHYSICAL ASSAULT WHATSOEVER. IT IS SIMPLY A REMARKABLY CIVIL REACTION TO A RATHER OUTRAGEOUS CIRCUMSTANCE.AND IN TERMS OF INFERRING FROM THAT ANY INTENT, MOTIVE OR IDENTITY OF THE PERPETRATOR OF THE 1994 MURDER, IT SIMPLY DOESN'T CUT IT. IT DOESN'T GET US ANYWHERE IN TERMS OF RESOLVING THE ISSUES WE HAVE TO RESOLVE IN THIS CASE.THE ITEMS NO. 22 AND 23. WITH RESPECT TO MR. ZLOMSOWITCH TESTIFYING THAT ON PRIOR OCCASIONS HE HAD BEEN AT A RESTAURANT AND OBSERVED MR. SIMPSON AT THE SAME RESTAURANT AND MR. SIMPSON ON ONE OCCASION TOLD HIM THAT MRS. SIMPSON WAS STILL HIS WIFE AND ON ANOTHER OCCASION ALLEGEDLY STARED AT HIM, AGAIN, JUST ASSUMING THAT THESE EVENTS TOOK PLACE, WHAT RELEVANCE DO THEY HAVE? WHAT DO THEY TELL US IN TERMS OF ANY MOTIVE OR INTENT REGARDING THE 1994 MURDER?THEY MAY TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT THE 1992 INCIDENT IN WHICH MR. ZLOMSOWITCH WAS ENGAGED IN SEXUAL ACTIVITY WITH MRS. SIMPSON, BUT THEY DON'T TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON TWO YEARS LATER IN 1994.ITEM 26. IN OCTOBER OF 1992, MR. AND MRS. SIMPSON WERE LEGALLY DIVORCED. AGAIN, THERE IS NO DISPUTE ABOUT THAT. IT REALLY HAS LIMITED RELEVANCE IN TERMS OF THE EVENTS OF THIS CASE.NO. 27. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ITEMS ON THIS LIST WHERE MR. SIMPSON REPORTEDLY CALLS MRS. SIMPSON'S MOTHER, JUDITHA BROWN IS THE MOTHER OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, AND HAS CONVERSATIONS WITH HER ABOUT THE STATUS OF HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH MRS. SIMPSON.THIS IS WHILE THE DIVORCE IS GOING ON. IT DOESN'T STRIKE ME AS AT ALL UNUSUAL THAT THERE WOULD BE THIS KIND OF FAMILY CONVERSATION ABOUT THE DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS AND ABOUT THE FEELINGS OF THE PARTIES THAT ARE ENGENDERED BY THOSE PROCEEDINGS, BUT AGAIN, WHAT RELEVANCE DOES IT HAVE? WHERE DOES IT GET US IN TERMS OF ESTABLISHING ANY MOTIVE OR INTENT WITH RESPECT TO THIS -- TO THIS MURDER? IT SIMPLY EXPLAINS THE PARTY'S REACTION TO THE DIVORCE THAT THEY ARE GOING THROUGH, AND THOSE REACTIONS APPEAR TO BE QUITE NORMAL, QUITE NATURAL AND REALLY PROVIDE NO ADDITIONAL CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE OF ANY -- ANY MOTIVE OR INTENT.AGAIN, ITEM 28. NO QUESTION ABOUT THIS. MR. AND MRS. SIMPSON DID ATTEMPT A RECONCILIATION BEGINNING IN MARCH OF 1993.ITEM 29. AGAIN WE ARE BACK TO ALLEGATIONS OF VERBAL ABUSE, THAT THERE WAS AN ARGUMENT OUTSIDE THE CALIFORNIA SUSHI BAR, AND AGAIN THERE WILL BE DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THIS ARGUMENT.IN FACT, FAYE RESNICK AND CHRISTIAN REICHARDT, THE ONLY TWO WITNESSES THAT ARE IDENTIFIED HERE, THEMSELVES HAD VERY DIFFERENT VERSIONS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. THE WITHDRAWAL OF FAYE RESNICK AS A WITNESS I THINK RAISES ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ABOUT OFFERING THIS IN EVIDENCE IF THERE ARE DIFFERING VERSIONS, AND THE PROSECUTION IS ONLY GOING TO PRESENT ONE, WITHOUT PRESENTING THE OTHER WITNESS WHO HAD A DIFFERENT VERSION OF WHAT HAPPENED.I THINK THAT RAISES A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER WE WILL EVER BE ABLE TO SORT OUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.BUT ONE THING WE KNOW DID NOT HAPPEN. THERE WAS NO PHYSICAL ABUSE. THIS WAS AN ARGUMENT TAKING PLACE IN FRONT OF A RESTAURANT. THE PARTIES GOT IN A CAR AND DROVE AWAY. AND WHAT DOES THAT TELL US IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENED IN JUNE OF 1994? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.ITEM 30 AND 31 RELATE TO THE TESTIMONY OF TWO NEIGHBORS WHO LIVED NEXT DOOR TO MRS. SIMPSON BEFORE SHE MOVED TO THE BUNDY ADDRESS. THIS IS ON THE GRETNA GREEN ADDRESS, AND THESE NEIGHBORS REPORT SEEING MR. SIMPSON OUTSIDE THE PREMISES LOOKING IN THE WINDOWS OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S AND THE TIMING FROM THEIR STATEMENTS AS TO WHEN THIS TOOK PLACE IS AT THE TIME OF THE RELATIONSHIP WITH MR. ZLOMSOWITCH, SO WE BELIEVE THAT WHAT IS BEING DESCRIBED HERE IS NOT SOMETHING THAT TOOK PLACE IN 1993, BUT RELATES TO THE SAME INCIDENT, NO. 24, THAT WILL BE PRESENTED IN MR. ZLOMSOWITCH'S TESTIMONY.WHY WAS MR. SIMPSON NEAR THE PREMISES OF MRS. SIMPSON? I MEAN, WHAT DOES THIS PROVE, THE FACT THAT HE WOULD OCCASIONALLY BE SEEN AT THE HOME WHERE MRS. SIMPSON WAS LIVING?I THINK WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT UNDER THE TERMS OF THE DIVORCE IN 1992, THEY WERE AWARDED JOINT CUSTODY OF THE CHILDREN, AND THE CHILDREN WERE WITH MRS. SIMPSON, SO OBVIOUSLY HE WOULD HAVE FREQUENT OCCASION TO VISIT THE PREMISES WHERE MRS. SIMPSON WAS LIVING, TO VISIT HIS CHILDREN.THE COLBYS ALSO REPORTED, AND THIS IS IN YOUR SUMMARY, THAT THEY OBSERVED THE DEFENDANT WOULD OFTEN LEAVE FLOWERS AT THE DOOR OF MRS. SIMPSON'S HOME. WHAT DOES THAT TELL US IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENED IN JUNE OF 1994, THAT ON PRIOR OCCASIONS, WHEN THEY WERE ATTEMPTING A RECONCILIATION IN THEIR MARRIAGE, MR. SIMPSON DELIVERED FLOWERS PERSONALLY TO THE HOME OF MRS. SIMPSON? IT DOESN'T GET US VERY FAR IN TERMS OF RESOLVING ANY ISSUES IN THIS CASE.ITEM 32 IS APPARENTLY THE SAME AS ITEM 35. I MEAN, IT JUST REPORTS SOME GENERAL STATEMENTS BY VARIOUS PEOPLE DESCRIBING WHAT HAPPENED IN THE 1993 911 INCIDENT, THAT MR. SIMPSON BARGED INTO MRS. SIMPSON'S HOME AND YELLED AT HER, THAT THERE WAS A DISCUSSION ABOUT NARCOTIC USAGE BY KATO KAELIN, THAT THERE WAS A DISCUSSION OF THE ZLOMSOWITCH INCIDENT.ALL OF THAT APPARENTLY RELATES TO THE OCTOBER, 1993, INCIDENT THAT IS ITEMIZED AS ITEM 35, AND I WILL GET TO THAT IN A MOMENT.ITEM 33, AGAIN MORE UNCORROBORATED RANK HEARSAY, JUST AN ALLEGATION THAT AT SOME POINT IN 1993, AND WE ARE NOT TOLD WHEN, MRS. SIMPSON MADE A STATEMENT TO SOME OTHER PERSON ABOUT HER BELIEF THAT MR. SIMPSON WAS -- WAS FOLLOWING HER.THAT IS HEARSAY. WE CAN'T CROSS-EXAMINE IT. AND ANY STATE OF MIND IN 1993, MUCH LESS IN 1994 WHEN THIS HAPPENED, IS NOT GOING TO BE AN ISSUE IN THIS CASE.SO THERE IS NO REASON WHY THAT CAN EVEN BE ADMITTED UNDER THE -- UNDER THE HEARSAY RULE.34, WE ARE NOT EVEN GIVEN A SOURCE. THIS IS JUST AN OUTRIGHT ALLEGATION IN THE PROSECUTION'S RESPONSE. WE BELIEVE THE SOURCE IS ALSO HEARSAY. APPARENTLY THIS IS SOMETHING THE PROSECUTORS PULLED OUT OF FAYE RESNICK'S BOOK TO BOLSTER THEIR RESPONSE TO THEIR MOTION, AND MISS RESNICK APPARENTLY, WHO IS NOT GOING TO BE A WITNESS, WAS REPORTING SOMETHING THAT WAS SAID TO HER BY THE -- BY THE VICTIM.SO NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE A HEARSAY STATEMENT, BUT THE PERSON WHO ALLEGEDLY HEARD THAT STATEMENT ISN'T GOING TO BE A WITNESS, SO I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO WORRY MUCH ABOUT ITEM 34.NOW, ITEM 35 BRINGS US TO THE 911 INCIDENT THAT EVERYBODY WAS TREATED TO HEARING IN GRAPHIC DETAIL WITH THE RELEASE OF THE 911 TAPES.I'M ASSUMING YOUR HONOR HAS A COPY OF THE TRANSCRIPT OF THAT 911 CALL, AND I THINK THIS IS A GOOD POINT WITH WHICH TO ADDRESS THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF THE ADMISSIBILITY OF 911 TAPES AS AN EXCEPTION TO THE HEARSAY RULE.OF COURSE THE TAPE ITSELF IS HEARSAY. THERE IS NO OPPORTUNITY TO CROSS-EXAMINE THE DECLARANT OF ANY OF THE STATEMENTS THAT APPEAR IN THE COURSE OF THIS -- OF THIS RECORDING, BUT THE -- THE PROSECUTION ALLEGES THAT IT COMES WITHIN THE WELL-DEFINED EXCEPTION TO THE HEARSAY RULE FOR SPONTANEOUS STATEMENTS.NOW, THE REQUIREMENT OF STATEMENTS COMING IN UNDER THE SPONTANEOUS STATEMENT EXCEPTION TO THE HEARSAY RULE REALLY GO TO THE ASSUMPTION OF RELIABILITY THAT COMES FROM PEOPLE SPEAKING UNDER THE STRESS OF EXCITEMENT.OF COURSE THE -- THE IDEA BEHIND THIS EXCEPTION TO THE HEARSAY RULE IS THAT WHEN -- WHEN SOMEONE IS NOT REFLECTING ON WHAT THEY ARE SAYING, THEY ARE JUST REACTING, THEY ARE JUST SPEAKING OUT ABOUT THINGS THAT THEY ARE OBSERVING AT THE SAME TIME THOSE THINGS ARE GOING ON AND THOSE THINGS ARE EXCITING, THAT PEOPLE WILL HAVE LESS OF A TENDENCY TO EXAGGERATE, TO PREVARICATE, THAT WE CAN COUNT ON THESE STATEMENTS AS BEING UNUSUALLY RELIABLE; THEREFORE, WE WILL ADMIT THEM WITHOUT THE NORMAL SAFEGUARD OF ALLOWING CROSS-EXAMINATION.AND ORDINARILY THESE KIND OF STATEMENTS ARE -- ARE VERY BRIEF, VERY REACTIVE KIND OF STATEMENTS, AND OF COURSE THE PROBLEM WE HAVE, THAT IS WE HAVE A 14-MINUTE CONVERSATION, A CONVERSATION IN WHICH THE 911 OPERATOR ASKS A NUMBER OF VERY POINTED QUESTIONS AND GETS VERY REFLECTIVE, POINTED RESPONSES.MANY OF THESE RESPONSES NOT ONLY HAVE PROBLEMS OF BEING HEARSAY, BUT THEY ARE EXPRESSIONS OF OPINION. FOR EXAMPLE, ""HE IS CRAZY, HE IS FUCKING GOING NUTS, HE IS GOING TO BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF ME."" I MEAN, THESE ARE JUST EXPRESSIONS OF OPINION THAT ARE NOT REACTIONS TO ANYTHING THAT IS HAPPENING OR DESCRIPTIVE OF ANYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED.I MEAN, THE ONE THING WE ABSOLUTELY KNOW FOR SURE ABOUT THIS INCIDENT OF OCTOBER, 1993, AND THAT IS THERE WAS NO PHYSICAL ABUSE. AT NO TIME IN ANY OF THESE EVENTS DID MR. SIMPSON EVER STRIKE NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, NOR IS THERE ANY ALLEGATION THAT HE THREATENED TO STRIKE HER, NOR IS THERE ANY EXPRESSION ON HER PART THAT SHE IS CONCERNED THAT HE IS ABOUT TO STRIKE HER.THE CONCERN AGAIN APPEARS TO BE, WELL, WHO IS GOING TO PAY TO FIX THE BROKEN DOOR THAT HE CAME THROUGH AND I'M WORRIED THAT HE IS GOING TO WAKE UP THE KIDS. THOSE ARE THE MOST VEHEMENT CONCERNS EXPRESSED IN THE COURSE OF THIS -- OF THIS CONVERSATION.AND OF COURSE THE REAL QUESTION WE HAVE WITH RESPECT TO THIS COMING IN AS EVIDENCE AS A PRIOR INCIDENT IS WHAT DOES THIS TELL US ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED ON JUNE 12, 1994?WHAT IS DESCRIBED HERE IS A VERY LOUD CONFRONTATION BETWEEN MR. SIMPSON AND NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, IN WHICH THEY ARGUED AND THE ARGUMENT WAS -- WAS OF COURSE A VERY PUBLIC ONE IN THE SENSE THAT POLICE OFFICERS RESPONDED, CALMED THEM DOWN.MR. KAELIN WAS PRESENT DURING -- DURING MOST OF THE ARGUMENT.WHAT DOES THAT TELL US IN TERMS OF EXPLAINING WHAT HAPPENED ON JUNE 12, 1994? IT TELLS US NOTHING, BUT THE POTENTIAL FOR PREJUDICE, ESPECIALLY SOMEBODY HEARING THIS TAPE, IS ENORMOUS, BECAUSE WE CAN, JUST FROM OUR OWN EXPERIENCE, ATTEST TO THE FACT THAT WHEN THIS TAPE WAS PLAYED ON EVERY TELEVISION SET IN THE COUNTRY, AND REPLAYED AND PLAYED AGAIN, THAT PEOPLE THOUGHT WHAT WAS GOING ON WAS A PHYSICAL ABUSE, THAT WHAT WAS GOING ON WAS MR. SIMPSON BARGING INTO THE HOUSE AND PHYSICALLY ASSAULTING MRS. SIMPSON.AND WE KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THAT DIDN'T TAKE PLACE, THAT THIS IS NOT EVEN AN INCIDENT OF PHYSICAL ABUSE. WHAT IT IS IS A VERY LOUD ARGUMENT BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE, AN ARGUMENT APPARENTLY ABOUT WHETHER BOTH OF THEM HAD CONFORMED TO AN UNDERSTANDING THAT PICTURES OF THE PARTIES INVOLVED IN PRIOR ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS WOULD NOT BE DISPLAYED, AND THAT IS WHAT THEY WERE ARGUING ABOUT.DOES THAT SUGGEST A MOTIVE FOR SOMEONE TO MURDER SOMEONE A YEAR LATER OR EIGHT MONTHS LATER? HARDLY.ITEM 36 AND 37 ARE BOTH AGAIN EXAMPLES OF HEARSAY, ALLEGATIONS THAT MRS. SIMPSON SAID TO OTHER THIRD PARTIES THAT SHE BELIEVED THAT MR. SIMPSON WAS -- WAS FOLLOWING HER AND SHE HAD REASON TO BE AFRAID OF HIM.AND AGAIN, NO OPPORTUNITY TO CROSS-EXAMINE ANY OF THIS, NO SUGGESTION OF ANY PLAUSIBLE EXCEPTION TO THE HEARSAY RULE. I GUESS, WHAT THE SUGGESTION WILL BE, THAT THIS PROVES SOMEHOW STATE OF MIND.AND AGAIN WE ASK: WELL, WHAT RELEVANCE DOES MRS. SIMPSON'S STATE OF MIND IN 1993 HAVE IN THIS CASE? WHAT RELEVANCE DOES HER STATE OF MIND ON THE VERY NIGHT THAT SHE WAS HEARD HAVE IN THIS CASE?AND THE ANSWER IS NONE, JUST AS THAT ANSWER WAS GIVEN IN THE IRELAND CASE AND IN THE ARCEGA CASE. THERE IS NO RELEVANCE. THAT STATE OF MIND IS NOT GOING TO BE AN ISSUE IN THIS CASE.ITEM 38. NO DISPUTE ABOUT THIS. IN JANUARY OF 1994 MRS. SIMPSON DID MOVE FROM THE GRETNA GREEN HOUSE TO THE PREMISES ON BUNDY DRIVE.ITEM 39. WE ARE TOLD THAT MR. KELLER WILL TESTIFY THAT WHILE HE WAS HAVING COFFEE AT STARBUCK'S WITH MRS. SIMPSON AND A NUMBER OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING RON GOLDMAN, THAT HE OBSERVED MR. SIMPSON DRIVING BY. MR. SIMPSON STOPPED HIS CAR AND NICOLE WALKED OVER AND SPOKE TO HIM IN THE AUTOMOBILE. HE CHARACTERIZED WHAT IS GOING ON AS SOME SHOUTING.AGAIN, EVEN THAT OF COURSE WILL BE DISPUTED, BUT EVEN IF THERE WAS SHOUTING, WHAT DOES THAT PROVE? THAT MR. SIMPSON SPOKE TO HIS WIFE IN A LOUD VOICE ON AN OCCASION WHEN HE HAPPENED TO BE DRIVING BY WHILE SHE IS SITTING HAVING COFFEE AT STARBUCK'S?WHAT DOES THAT TELL US? DOES THAT SUGGEST A MOTIVE FOR A MURDER? DOES THAT SUGGEST THAT ASSUMING MR. SIMPSON IS -- IS THE MURDERER, THAT HE HAD A PARTICULAR INTENT OR PREMEDITATION? DOES IT SUGGEST EVEN THAT HE WAS IN FACT THE MURDERER? DOES IT ESTABLISH HIS IDENTITY? AND OF COURSE IT DOES NONE OF THESE THINGS.IT IS SIMPLY IRRELEVANT.ITEM 40. AGAIN A CONVERSATION WITH -- WITH MRS. SIMPSON'S MOTHER AND AGAIN HEARSAY WHICH REALLY -- AS TO WHICH WE HAVE NO PLAUSIBLE -- I'M SORRY. THIS IS NOT A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE DEFENDANT AND THE MOTHER, BUT BETWEEN MRS. SIMPSON AND HER MOTHER, SO IT IS HEARSAY, IT DOESN'T COME WITHIN ANY RECOGNIZED EXCEPTION TO THE HEARSAY RULE.ITEM 41 IS AGAIN ANOTHER CONVERSATION BETWEEN MR. SIMPSON AND MRS. SIMPSON'S MOTHER. NO HEARSAY PROBLEM OF COURSE SINCE IT IS A STATEMENT OF THE -- OF THE DEFENDANT.THE REAL PROBLEM IS RELEVANCE. WHAT RELEVANCE DOES IT HAVE THAT IN THE COURSE OF AN ATTEMPT TO WORK OUT A RECONCILIATION MR. SIMPSON SAYS TO HIS FORMER WIFE'S MOTHER THAT SHE IS THE ONLY WOMAN HE WANTS IN HIS LIFE AND HE CAN'T HAVE HER, IF IN FACT THAT WAS SAID, AND AGAIN, THERE ARE LIKELY TO BE CONFLICTING VERSIONS OF WHAT WAS ACTUALLY SAID.BUT EVEN IF WE ASSUME THAT THIS WAS WHAT WAS SAID, DOES THAT ESTABLISH A MOTIVE FOR A MURDER?WITH RESPECT TO ITEM NO. 42, THE TESTIMONY OF BILL THIBODEAU, WHO AGAIN, ONE OF THOSE WITNESSES WHO HAS BEEN ON TELEVISION, SO HE WON'T BE PRESENTING THIS STORY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS COURTROOM, HE HAS MADE THE ROUNDS OF THE T.V. SHOWS, AND THERE IS A SERIOUS QUESTION GOING TO BE RAISED ABOUT -- ABOUT HIS CREDIBILITY, ABOUT THE ACCURACY OF HIS REPORTS OF WHAT WAS SAID, BUT EVEN IF WE ASSUME THAT EVERYTHING THAT HE ALLEGEDLY SAYS MR. SIMPSON SAID, IT DOESN'T OFFER ANY ELUCIDATION IN TERMS OF A POTENTIAL MOTIVE. IT IS SIMPLY RELEVANT. IT GETS US NOWHERE IN TERMS OF RESOLVING THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO RESOLVE IN THIS CASE.ITEM 43, AGAIN THIS IS FAYE RESNICK, AND THERE MAY BE OTHER WITNESSES OTHER THAN FAYE RESNICK WHO WILL DESCRIBE AN INCIDENT APPARENTLY IN MEXICO WHILE THEY ARE ON VACATION WHERE MR. SIMPSON ALLEGEDLY RIDICULES HIS WIFE'S FEAR OF FROGS AND POINTS OUT THE IRONY THAT HE IS NOW STARING IN A NEW T.V. SERIES CALLED FROGMAN.IS THIS A MOTIVE? WHAT DOES THIS TELL US? IT TELLS US ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THAT IS IN ANY WAY RELEVANT TO ANY ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TO RESOLVE IN THIS CASE, SO OUR OBJECTION IS SIMPLY THAT IT IS IRRELEVANT.ITEM 44, ITEM 49, ITEM 51 ARE ALL ITEMS THAT ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO NO ONE OTHER THAN FAYE RESNICK, AND THE ANNOUNCED INTENTION OF THE PROSECUTION THAT THEY WILL NOT CALL FAYE RESNICK SHOULD DISPOSE OF THESE MATTERS, SINCE THAT IS THE ONLY WAY IN WHICH ANY OF THESE ITEMS COULD BE -- COULD BE PROVEN.AND OF COURSE THAT IS TRUE OF 45, TOO; 44, 45, 49 AND 51.ITEM 46 AND 48 ARE BOTH HEARSAY. IN ONE CASE WE ARE TOLD TO WHOM THESE STATEMENTS WERE MADE BY MISS SIMPSON, AND IN THE OTHER CASE WE DON'T EVEN KNOW TO WHOM THEY WERE TOLD, ALTHOUGH WE SUSPECT IT IS AGAIN FAYE RESNICK. IT IS JUST RANK HEARSAY. WHAT DOES IT PROVE?STATE OF MIND IS THE ONLY POTENTIAL EXCEPTION THAT COMES TO MIND, AND STATE OF MIND SIMPLY ISN'T AT ISSUE IN THIS CASE.ITEM 47, THERE IS NO DISPUTE ABOUT THAT. THE ATTEMPT AT A RECONCILIATION DID END IN MAY OF 1994.ITEM 50. WE ARE TOLD ABOUT A LETTER ALLEGEDLY FROM MR. SIMPSON'S ATTORNEY, SKIP TAFT, RESTATING A THREAT TO INFORM THE IRS OF SOME DIFFICULTY WITH RESPECT TO A DEDUCTION WITH REGARD TO THE SALE AND PURCHASE OF A RESIDENCE BY MRS. SIMPSON.I HOPE YOUR HONOR WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT LETTER, BECAUSE THAT IS NOT REALLY WHAT THE LETTER SAYS OR IMPLIES. IT IS NOT A LETTER FROM MR. TAFT; IT IS A LETTER FROM MR. SIMPSON, SO THERE IS NO HEARSAY PROBLEM. IT IS ON HIS OWN LETTERHEAD AND HE EXPRESSES CONCERNS ABOUT MISREPRESENTATIONS BEING MADE IN WHICH IN ORDER TO AVOID THE PAYMENT OF TAXES, MRS. SIMPSON WAS CLAIMING THAT MR. SIMPSON'S HOME WAS HER PRINCIPAL ADDRESS. AND THIS SIMPLY INFORMS HER THAT THAT IS GOING TO PRESENT SOME COMPLICATIONS AND THAT SHE SHOULD MAKE OTHER ARRANGEMENTS.THERE WERE NO THREATS IN THIS LETTER. THERE WAS NO ATTEMPT TO USE THIS IN ANY WAY TO GET HER TO DO ANYTHING.IT SIMPLY STATED WHAT WAS AN OBVIOUS FACT, THAT THAT KIND OF MISREPRESENTATION COULD PRESENT PROBLEMS FOR BOTH OF THEM, AND SOME OTHER ARRANGEMENTS SHOULD BE MADE, AND AGAIN WE WOULD ASK WHAT RELEVANCE THAT HAS IN TERMS OF ANY OF THE EVENTS THAT WE HAVE TO LITIGATE IN THIS CASE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED ON JUNE 12?ITEMS 52 AND 53. AGAIN RANK HEARSAY. EVERY ONE OF THESE ITEMS IS SOMETHING THAT MRS. SIMPSON ALLEGEDLY SAID TO SOME THIRD PARTY. IN ONE CASE DENISE BROWN, IN THE OTHER CASE, BETSY ROCKETT, AND THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHERE IS THE EXCEPTION TO THE HEARSAY RULE? THESE ARE NOT STATEMENTS THAT CAN BE CROSS-EXAMINED AND STATE OF MIND IS NOT GOING TO BE AN ISSUE IN THIS CASE.ITEM 54, THE SAME THING. MORE HEARSAY. THIS TIME THE RECIPIENT OF THE HEARSAY WAS ALLEGEDLY CORA FICHMAN AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE NOW GETTING CLOSER TO THE ACTUAL DATE OF THE MURDER, THAT SOMEHOW THAT MAKES STATE OF MIND MORE RELEVANT, WE WOULD SIMPLY UNDERLINE THE HOLDINGS IN THE CASES IN IRELAND AND ARCEGA DEALING WITH STATEMENTS MADE VIRTUALLY THE SAME DAY THAT THE MURDER TOOK PLACE AND THE COURT SAID IT IS STILL NOT AN ISSUE IN THE MURDER CASE AS TO WHAT THE VICTIM'S STATE OF MIND WAS, AND THAT IS TRUE IN THIS CASE.NOBODY IS GOING TO MAKE AN ISSUE ABOUT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S OR RONALD GOLDMAN'S STATE OF MIND AT THE TIME THEY WERE MURDERED.ITEMS 55, 56 AND 57. THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE ANY DISPUTE ABOUT ANY OF THOSE. THOSE ALL RELATE TO THE EVENTS ON THE EVENING OF JUNE 12, EXCEPT IT IS NOT QUITE ACCURATE TO SAY THEY SEPARATELY ATTENDED A DANCE RECITAL. THEY WERE BOTH AT THE RECITAL. THEY WERE SEATED WITHIN TWO ROWS OF EACH OTHER.THE REFERENCE TO THE DEFENDANT NOT BEING INVITED TO DINNER, THE DEFENDANT DIDN'T ASK TO BE INVITED TO DINNER. THE RELEVANCE OF THAT REALLY ESCAPES US, AND OF COURSE THE MURDER OCCURRED LATER THAT EVENING.ITEM 58 AND 59 AGAIN RAISE SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE RELEVANCE OF THE STATEMENTS MADE BY MR. SIMPSON AT THE FUNERAL OF HIS WIFE ARE. I DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD SERIOUSLY CONTEND THAT IN ANY WAY THESE WERE AN ADMISSION, THAT THE PEOPLE HE WAS SPEAKING TO IN INDICATING THE -- THE GRIEF THAT HE WAS EXPERIENCING AND SAYING THAT HE LOVED HIS WIFE IS SOMEHOW IMPLIEDLY AN ADMISSION THAT HE KILLED HER.THAT IS JUST SIMPLY STRETCHING THINGS BEYOND ANY CREDULITY AND SIMILARLY.THE CALL THAT HE MADE TO THE FAMILY WHEN HE WAS RETURNING FROM CHICAGO DID NOT IMPLY ANY SORT OF ADMISSION AND WE ARE JUST RAISING A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THIS HAS ANY RELEVANCE AT ALL IN TERMS OF -- OF WHAT PURPOSE -- THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT IS BEING OFFERED.WE HAVE A NUMBER OF ADDED EVENTS, AS I INDICATED EARLIER. THE CHALLENGE TO MR. SIMPSON TO EXPLAIN HIS WHOLE LIFE GROWS DAY BY DAY, AND WE NOW HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES, ADDENDUM TO THE PEOPLE'S RESPONSE WITH RESPECT TO TWO NEIGHBORS WHO IN 1978 OR 1979 -- BEAR IN MIND THAT THIS IS SEVEN YEARS BEFORE MR. AND MRS. SIMPSON WERE EVEN MARRIED, THIS IS WHILE THEY WERE LIVING TOGETHER BEFORE THEY WERE EVEN MARRIED -- TWO NEIGHBORS, THROUGH THE BEDROOM WALL, REPORT THAT THEY HEARD A VERY LOUD ARGUMENT AND THAT ON A SUBSEQUENT OCCASION THEY OBSERVED MRS. SIMPSON HAD BLACK EYES.WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THAT. IT -- CERTAINLY IT HAS NO RELEVANCE WHATSOEVER TO ANYTHING THAT TOOK PLACE SIXTEEN YEARS LATER ON JUNE 12 OF 1994. IT CERTAINLY CAN'T BE SUGGESTED THAT THIS OFFERS ANY THEORY OF A MOTIVE OR PROVES INTENT OR PROVES THE IDENTITY OF THE PERPETRATOR OF A MURDER SIXTEEN YEARS LATER.AND AUTHENTICATING THIS IN TERMS OF WHO WAS EVEN IN THAT BEDROOM IS GOING TO BE AN INSURMOUNTABLE TASK THAT WILL PRESENT A SERIOUS 403 QUESTION WHETHER THIS WILL EVEN BE ADMISSIBLE. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO LITIGATE WHETHER IN FACT WHAT THEY WERE HEARING WAS EVEN AN ARGUMENT BETWEEN MR. AND MRS. SIMPSON, MUCH LESS WHETHER THAT ARGUMENT HAS ANY RELEVANCE TO THESE PROCEEDINGS.THE OTHER ADD-ON WAS AGAIN AN EVENT -- ALLEGED EVENT THAT WILL RAISE A SUBSTANTIAL 403 QUESTION AS TO WHETHER IT EVER TOOK PLACE. WE ARE TOLD THAT MR. SIMPSON IS NOW GOING TO HAVE TO SEARCH HIS MEMORY FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR OF 1986 AND 1987 AS TO ANY OCCASIONS ON WHICH HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AT THE BEACH WITH MRS. SIMPSON, AND -- AND THE INCREDIBLE ALLEGATION IS THAT ON A PUBLIC BEACH IN THE PRESENCE OF PRESUMABLY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE MR. SIMPSON STRUCK HIS WIFE AND KNOCKED HERB TO THE GROUND.I THINK THERE IS GOING TO BE A SUBSTANTIAL ISSUE OF THE ABILITY OF THIS WITNESS TO ACTUALLY MAKE AN IDENTIFICATION NINE YEARS LATER. SUDDENLY THIS PERSON REMEMBERS, NINE YEARS AGO I WAS AT THE BEACH AND I SAW O.J. SIMPSON HIT HIS WIFE.WELL, EVEN IF THAT IS CREDIBLE, EVEN IF THAT IS BELIEVABLE, WE HAVE TO ASK WHAT DOES IT PROVE? WHAT IS THE RELEVANCE? HOW DOES THAT ESTABLISH ANY MOTIVE, ANY INTENT OR THE IDENTITY OF ANYONE INVOLVED IN A MURDER ON JUNE 12, 1994?THE OTHER RECENT DEVELOPMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE SOJOURN ITEM THAT WAS JUST PRESENTED IN COURT THIS MORNING, AGAIN, JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF ATTEMPT TO USE HEARSAY IN THIS CASE, WHICH IS NOT SUBJECT TO CROSS-EXAMINATION, APART FROM ALL OF THE PROBLEMS OF AUTHENTICATION OF WHO THIS ACTUALLY WAS REFERRED TO IN THAT -- IN THAT REPORT.EVEN IF THOSE PROBLEMS ARE OVERCOME, THE QUESTION IS IT IS HEARSAY. WHAT HEARSAY EXCEPTION DOES IT COME WITHIN?SO YOUR HONOR, WHEN WE BOIL IT ALL DOWN, WHAT WE HAVE IN THIS -- IN THIS CHRONOLOGY IS AN AWFUL LOT OF HEARSAY, UNCORROBORATED HEARSAY, HEARSAY THAT THE DEFENDANT CANNOT CROSS-EXAMINE, HEARSAY THAT COMES WITHIN NO RECOGNIZED EXCEPTION TO THE HEARSAY RULE, THE ONLY POTENTIAL EXCEPTION BEING STATE OF MIND, WHICH IS NOT IN ISSUE IN THIS CASE, AND IT CAN'T BE MADE AN ISSUE JUST TO BOOTSTRAP THIS EVIDENCE.THE PROSECUTION CAN'T SOMEHOW CONSTRUCT SOME CONVOLUTED THEORY OF THE EVIDENCE THAT MAKES THE STATE OF MIND OF THE VICTIM AN ISSUE JUST AS A DEVICE TO PULL IN ALL OF THESE ITEMS OF UNCORROBORATED HEARSAY.WE HAVE A LOT OF ITEMS AS TO WHICH THERE WILL BE NO WITNESSES AT TRIAL, BECAUSE THE PROSECUTION HAS ANNOUNCED THEY ARE NOT CALLING FAYE RESNICK AND FAYE RESNICK IS THE ONLY REPORTED WITNESS TO THESE INCIDENTS.WE HAVE A NUMBER OF STATEMENTS ATTRIBUTED TO THE DEFENDANT OF HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE RELEVANCE THAT REALLY OFFER NO INSIGHT INTO ANY STATE OF MIND OF THE DEFENDANT THAT WOULD BE RELEVANT ON JUNE 12, 1994.AND WHAT WE DO HAVE IN TERMS OF ANY INCIDENTS THAT CAN, BY THE WILDEST CHARACTERIZATION BE CALLED INCIDENTS OF ABUSE, DO NOT INVOLVE PHYSICAL ABUSE IN MOST OF THE CASES, THE SINGLE EXCEPTION BEING THE 1989 INCIDENT IN WHICH MR. SIMPSON WAS PLACED ON PROBATION, MANY OF WHICH ARE VERY REMOTE TO ANYTHING THAT TOOK PLACE IN THIS CASE, LONG BEFORE 1994.IN FACT, IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THERE ARE SO FEW IN THE COURSE OF A 17-YEAR RELATIONSHIP, AND YET INCIDENTS THAT COULD BE VERY PREJUDICIAL, VERY TIME-CONSUMING, VERY CONFUSING TO THE JURY IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY ARE TO MAKE OF ANY OF THIS.WHAT WE END UP WITH IS A BUMPY MARRIAGE IN WHICH THE PARTIES ARGUED A LOT, PROBABLY NO MORE THAN USUAL IN -- IN MANY MARRIAGES. ALL OF THE GOOD MOMENTS OF THAT MARRIAGE ARE LEFT OUT, AND PROBABLY THE LOW POINTS ARE THE 1989 NEW YEAR'S PARTY INCIDENT, THE ZLOMSOWITCH INCIDENT IN 1992, AND THE ARGUMENT OVER THE BROKEN DOOR IN 1993.AND WITH RESPECT TO EACH OF THOSE INCIDENTS, THE QUESTION WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES IS HOW SIMILAR ARE ANY OF THESE INCIDENTS TO WHAT HAPPENED ON JUNE 12, 1994, WHEN TWO PEOPLE WERE BRUTALLY STABBED TO DEATH ON A SIDEWALK OUTSIDE OF THEIR HOME? HOW DOES ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED IN A PUSHING AND SHOVING ARGUMENT FOLLOWING A NEW YEAR'S EVE PARTY RESOLVE ANY OF THE ISSUES WE HAVE TO RESOLVE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED ON JUNE 12? HOW DOES ANY EVIDENCE ABOUT THE CONFRONTATION OF A MAN ENGAGED IN SEXUAL ACTIVITY WITH HIS WIFE ILLUMINATE WHAT HAPPENED ON JUNE 12, 1994? AND HOW DOES A LOUD ARGUMENT ABOUT WHAT KIND OF PICTURES ARE IN A FAMILY ALBUM LEADING TO THE BREAKING OF A DOOR IN 1993 ILLUMINATE ANY OF THOSE ISSUES?NO MATTER WHAT LABEL YOU PUT ON THESE INCIDENTS, IF YOU WANT TO CALL THEM SPOUSAL ABUSE, EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T MEET THE LEGAL DEFINITION OF SPOUSAL ABUSE, WHERE DOES THAT TAKE US IN TERMS OF THE REAL ISSUE THAT WE WANT TO LITIGATE IN THIS TRIAL? AND THAT IS THE ISSUE OF WHO KILLED NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON AND RONALD GOLDMAN.AND WE SUBMIT THAT NONE OF THIS EVIDENCE IS GOING TO TAKE US DOWN THE ROAD TO ANSWERING THAT QUESTION IN THIS TRIAL.MAY I CONFER WITH CO-COUNSEL?BETWEEN DEFENSE COUNSEL.)

#MR. GORDON: ,"THANK YOU.YOUR HONOR, THIS MORNING, IN MR. UELMEN'S COMMENTS, HE KEPT REFERRING TO THE FACT THAT THIS IS A MURDER CASE, THAT THESE INSTANCES WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND WILL DISCUSS TODAY BEAR NO RELEVANCE, HAVE NO SIMILARITY WHATSOEVER.THE POINT THAT IS BEING MISSED AND WHAT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD IN THIS CASE AND IN ALL CASES OF SPOUSAL ABUSE AND SPOUSAL HOMICIDE IS THAT THE EVENTS THAT TAKE PLACE THAT LEAD UP TO THAT HOMICIDE ARE COMPLETELY TOTALLY WELDED AND LINKED TO THAT TERMINAL ACT.THE DEFENSE IS RIGHT, THIS IS A MURDER CASE. WHERE THE DIFFERENCE IS IS THAT WHAT MUST BE RECOGNIZED IS THAT THIS MURDER TOOK 17 YEARS TO COMMIT.IN A HOUSEHOLD -- IN ANY HOME OR HOUSEHOLD IN WHICH VIOLENCE BECOMES PART OF THAT RELATIONSHIP, THOSE PUNCHES, SLAPS, THAT PUSHING IS A PRELUDE TO A HOMICIDE. THAT HAS TO BE RECOGNIZED. IT IS DOCUMENTED. IT HAS BEEN EMPIRICALLY RESEARCHED, AND WE'LL DEMONSTRATE THAT.THE PATTERN OF ABUSE AND CONTROL WHICH CHARACTERIZED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DEFENDANT AND NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON IS TEXTBOOK. IT MIRRORS AND ILLUSTRATES WHAT HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED OVER THE YEARS STARTING WITH DR. WALKER, WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT, THE DEFENSE HAS TALKED ABOUT AND HAS BEEN ILLUSTRATED IN THE YEAR SINCE HER INITIAL RESEARCH.THE DEFENSE KEEPS -- CHARACTERIZES THIS EVIDENCE OF PRIOR HISTORY OF ABUSE AS CHARACTER EVIDENCE. THIS IS TRANSACTIONAL EVIDENCE, YOUR HONOR, AND THAT'S WHAT ZACK TALKS ABOUT. AND WE WILL EXPLAIN LATER HOW IT WORKS.THIS EVIDENCE IS PART OF THIS TRANSACTION. IT CERTAINLY HAS RELEVANCE, AND IN THERE CERTAINLY ARE THEORIES OF ADMISSIBILITY UNDER TRADITIONAL 1101(B) ANALYSIS.BUT BEFORE YOU GET THERE, IT HAS TO BE RECOGNIZED THAT THE PATTERN IN A -- PATTERN OF ABUSE THAT LEADS UP TO THE DEATH OF A SPOUSE, DEATH OF AN INTIMATE CAN NOT BE TORN AWAY OR BROKEN AWAY FROM THAT TERMINAL ACT OF ABUSE PER HER DEATH, HER MURDER.THE DEFENSE HAS STATED THERE'S NO RELATIONSHIP IN ANY OF THESE ACTS, IN ANY OF THESE ACTS OF ABUSE, THE DEATH ACCOMPLISHED AGAINST HIS WIFE IS NO RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THAT AND A HOMICIDE.THIS MORNING, MR. UELMEN ARGUED THAT THERE ARE NO CHARACTERISTICS -- THAT THE MURDER THAT WE HAD OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON AND RONALD GOLDMAN WAS NOT A TYPICAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MURDER. THOSE ARGUMENTS THIS MORNING WERE ANALOGIZED TO A DRUG SCENE MURDER. THERE WAS NO DATA OFFERED WHATSOEVER WITH THAT, AND IN FACT IT'S COMPLETELY WRONG. IT'S COMPLETELY WRONG.ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS VERY CONCERNING ABOUT ANY CASE WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, WHETHER IT'S AT THE INITIAL STAGES WITH AN ASSAULT UP TO A HOMICIDE, IS THAT THERE ARE MANY MISCONCEPTIONS WITHIN THE PUBLIC ABOUT SPOUSAL ABUSE.SPOUSAL ABUSE IS A CRIME, SOMETHING THAT OCCURS WITHIN SECRET, WITHIN THE SHADOWS. IT CAN ONLY BE UNDERSTOOD WHEN IT'S BROUGHT OUT INTO THE LIGHT.AND THE ARGUMENTS THAT WERE MADE TODAY ARE EXACTLY, EXACTLY THE MISCONCEPTIONS WHICH HAVE LED TO THE NEED FOR TESTIMONY, EXPERT TESTIMONY.THERE'S LITERATURE THAT'S COME UP TO MINIMIZE INCIDENTS, TO ARGUE THAT ABUSE IS NOT PHYSICAL VIOLENCE, TO ARGUE THAT BOTH PARTIES WERE JUST DRINKING, THEY WERE JUST WRESTLING, ALL IT WAS WAS PHYSICAL DAMAGE WHEN SOMEONE IS SITTING INSIDE A CAR AND HAS HER HUSBAND, AN EX-PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL PLAYER HITTING THAT CAR WITH A BASEBALL BAT, WORRYING ABOUT THE WINDSHIELD, HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST.THOSE KINDS OF TRADITIONAL SITUATIONS OF VIOLENCE AND ABUSE, THAT KIND OF -- THE VICTIM BLAMING THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR ON THE PUBLIC'S MISCONCEPTIONS IS EXACTLY THE PROBLEM IN THIS CASE, EXACTLY THE PROBLEM IN MANY CASES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.WITH REGARD TO THE SIMILARITIES THAT COUNSEL HAS ASKED FOR, WHAT A TRADITIONAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOMICIDE LOOKS LIKE, THAT HAS BEEN STUDIED.ONE LENGTHY STUDY WAS DONE IN ONTARIO IN 1992 AS PREPARED FOR THE ONTARIO WOMEN'S AUXILIARY. IT WAS A STUDY IN WHICH ALL WOMEN KILLED BETWEEN 1974 AND 1990 IN ONTARIO, CANADA CASES WERE DIRECT RESULTS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.AND THE STUDIES I AM GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT HAVE BEEN REPLICATED AND DUPLICATED FROM NUMEROUS OTHER STUDIES; SOME ARE UNITED STATES STUDIES, SOME ARE CANADIAN STUDIES AND SOME ARE AUSTRALIAN STUDIES. IN FACT, THE SAMPLING, WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL THE STUDIES, WHICH FIND IDENTICAL RESULTS, IS UP TO AROUND 3,000 SPOUSAL ASSAULTS THAT HAVE BEEN LOOKED AT. IT'S VERY, VERY SIGNIFICANT DATA.WHAT THE STUDIES SHOW IS THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SPOUSAL HOMICIDE, AND THEY'RE ILLUSTRATED ON THE CHART WE PRESENT.FIRST OF ALL, IT MUST BE RECOGNIZED THAT WOMEN THAT ARE KILLED, THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE KILLED BY INTIMATES. AND BY INTIMATES, I'M TALKING ABOUT THAT PRIOR EMOTIONAL RELATIONSHIP IN THEIR LIFE, HUSBAND, BOYFRIEND, EX-BOYFRIEND, THAT PRIMARY LOVE RELATIONSHIP.IN FACT, IN THE STUDY THAT WAS DONE IN ONTARIO, SOME 61 PERCENT OF ALL THE WOMEN KILLED IN THOSE YEARS WERE IN FACT KILLED BY AN INTIMATE.AND SPOUSAL KILLING IS A CRIME THAT AFFECTS WOMEN. 75 PERCENT OF ALL SPOUSAL KILLINGS IN THAT TIME, THREE-QUARTERS OF THEM, THE WOMAN WAS THE VICTIM.IN FACT, WHEN LOOKING AT ALL HOMICIDES, AT ALL -- BOTH MALE AND FEMALE HOMICIDES AS VICTIMS WHEN I'M SAYING THAT -- OF ALL MEN THAT WERE KILLED IN THAT TIME, EIGHT PERCENT OF THE MEN WERE KILLED BY THEIR SPOUSES. YET, 50 PERCENT OF WOMEN THAT WERE KILLED WERE KILLED BY SPOUSES. THAT'S NOT SIGNIFICANT OTHERS, BUT ACTUALLY BY SPOUSES.64 PERCENT OF THE WOMEN WHO WERE VICTIMS OF INTIMATE HOMICIDE WERE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 20 AND 39.SOME OF THE CHARACTERISTICS THAT CAME OUT BEAR STRIKING RESEMBLANCE TO THE CASE WE HAVE HERE.JUST WHAT MAKES IT SUCH A TYPICAL SPOUSAL KILLING? COUNSEL HAD ASKED FOR WHAT THOSE SIMILARITIES ARE.IN THE CASES STUDIED, 90 PERCENT OF THE WOMEN HAVE REPORTED PRIOR ACTS OF ABUSE BY THE OFFENDER. IN 83 PERCENT OF THE CASES, THE OFFENDER HAD MADE THREATS TO THE VICTIM. IN 65 PERCENT OF THOSE CASES, THERE HAD BEEN PRIOR POLICE INVOLVEMENT IN THOSE CASES, JUST LIKE IN THIS CASE.IN THOSE CASES -- WHEN IT WAS STUDIED, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS LOOKED AT THAT WE DISCUSSED TODAY WAS MOTIVE. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT SPOUSAL KILLING, ONE MOTIVE DOES STAND CLEAR; AND THAT IS ESTRANGEMENT. ESTRANGEMENT.CONTROL IS AT THE HEART OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THE BEHAVIOR AND ABUSES THAT A BATTERER PUTS FORTH ON HIS VICTIM AND WHEN -- HERE'S WHERE WE TALK ABOUT SIMILARITIES OF ONE DESIGN AND ONE INTENT.THEY ARE MECHANISMS OF CONTROL. THEY ARE MECHANISMS TO KEEP THIS WOMAN WITHIN HIS POWER. AND THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THESE DIFFERENT ACTS IN RELATIONSHIP TO ONE ANOTHER.IN 45 PERCENT OF THE CASES WHICH WERE REPORTED, ALMOST HALF, ONE MOTIVE EXISTED; AND THAT WAS ESTRANGEMENT. THE SECOND LEADING MOTIVE, WHICH IS AN ADDITIONAL 15 PERCENT OF THE CASES, WAS THE OFFENDER SUSPICION, THAT SOME OTHER MAN WAS INVOLVED WITH THE WOMAN.THE NOTION OF JEALOUSY AND ESTRANGEMENT ARE TWO THINGS THAT ARE VERY, VERY STRONG HERE, THAT REOCCUR HERE, THAT WERE DYNAMICS IN PART OF THIS RELATIONSHIP EVEN BEFORE THESE TWO PEOPLE WERE MARRIED UNTIL THE DAY THAT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON DIED.MOST OF THE OFFENDERS STUDIED HERE ATTACKED THEIR VICTIMS IN CLOSE PHYSICAL CONTACT. IN ALMOST 60 PERCENT OF THE CASES, THE OFFENDER STABBED, BLUDGEONED, STRANGLED, STABBED OR SLASHED THE THROATS OF THEIR VICTIMS. AND OF THIS FACIAL ASSAULT INVOLVEMENT THEME OR EXCESSIVE VIOLENCE, MOST ARE GRUESOME CRIME SCENES, A LOT OF VIOLENCE.IN FACT, IT WAS NOTED THAT MANY OF THE KILLINGS, THE OFFENDERS INFLICTED HARM WAY BEYOND NECESSARY TO KILL THE VICTIM. AND THIS IS A QUOTE FROM THE REPORT.FOR EXAMPLE, MORE THAN HALF THE STABBINGS INVOLVED MULTIPLE STAB WOUNDS; IN MANY CASES, DOZENS OF WOUNDS OVER THE ENTIRE BODY. IN FACT, IT WAS NOTED IN THE REPORT THAT MANY OF THE POLICE OFFICERS AND CORONERS THAT HAVE WORKED WITH THE CASES AND DONE THE AUTOPSIES COMMENTED THAT THESE WERE SOME OF THE MOST GRUESOME CRIME SCENES THEY HAD EVER ENCOUNTERED.18 PERCENT OF THESE SPOUSAL KILLINGS OCCURRED AT OR NEAR THE VICTIM'S HOME.THIS REPORT FOUND THAT WOMEN THAT ARE ESTRANGED, RECENTLY ESTRANGED FROM THEIR SPOUSES, SPOUSES IN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS ARE FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE KILLED BY INTIMATE PARTNERS THAN ANY OTHER REASON.IN FACT, THE REPORT WENT ON TO PROFILE A CERTAIN SET OF WOMEN, CERTAIN POPULATION OF WOMEN THAT ARE MOST AT RISK FOR SPOUSAL KILLING. SOME OF THE FACTORS THEY IDENTIFIED WERE WOMEN WHO HAD BEEN RECENTLY ESTRANGED OR SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARTNERS, AGE, BETWEEN 30 TO 44, WHO HAD NOT WORKED OUT OF HOME IN RECENT YEARS AND CENTERED THE MAJORITY OF THEIR LIFE WITHIN THEIR HOME.NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON THROUGHOUT THE HISTORY THAT MS. BODIN WILL TALK ABOUT ECHOED HER FEARS, ECHOED THE FEARS THAT SHE WOULD BE KILLED BY THE DEFENDANT. IN FACT, SHE CHRONICLED HER ABUSE AND LEFT A TRAIL. IT SHOULD NOT BE AN ECHO THAT SHOULD BE IGNORED.DEFENSE WANTS OTHER RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SPOUSAL ABUSE AND KILLING.IN 1993, THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE ARTICLE BY DR. KELLERMAN SAID THAT THE DATA THAT WAS STUDIED THERE STRONGLY SUGGESTED THAT THE RISK OF HOMICIDE IS MARKEDLY INCREASED IN HOMES WHERE A PERSON HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN HIT OR HURT IN A FAMILY FIGHT. IN FACT, IT WENT ON TO ADVISE PUBLIC AGENCIES THAT EARLY IDENTIFICATION AND INTERVENTION IS HOMICIDE PREVENTION.IN THE LEGAL ARGUMENTS WE'LL BE TALKING TODAY -- TALKING ABOUT TODAY, THE DEFENSE HAS ARGUED THAT TO ALLOW THIS EVIDENCE IN WOULD BE CARVING OUT SOME SPECIAL RULE.THIS IS NOT THE FACT. THE FACT IS THAT THE LAW SAYS THAT EVIDENCE WITHIN RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASES, THIS NOTION OF TRANSACTIONAL EVIDENCE DOES IN FACT COME IN.MR. GOLDBERG WILL DISCUSS PRESENT LAW NOT ONLY RELATING TO STALKING, BUT CASES THAT GO BACK TO 1909 AND A LONG LINE OF CASES THAT STAND FOR THIS CRIME.IF ANY SPECIAL RULE WILL BE CARVED OUT TODAY, THAT WILL BE A RULE WHICH WOULD BE TO EXCLUDE THIS EVIDENCE, A RULE WHICH WOULD EXCLUDE THE EVIDENCE OF THE PATTERN OF ABUSE SUFFERED BY THIS VICTIM, A RULE WHICH WOULD EXCLUDE THE POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN VOICED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THIS STATE AND STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, WHICH IS THAT ISSUES WITH REGARD TO BATTERED WOMEN, WITH REGARD TO SPOUSAL ABUSE SHOULD COME INTO THE LIGHT OF DAY.IN OUR ARGUMENT TODAY, WE BROKE UP -- AND FOR THE COURT'S INFORMATION, MS. BODIN WILL GO THROUGH AND PRESENT THE FACTS AS WE PERCEIVE THE FACTS HERE, EXPLAIN HOW THEY FIT INTO A PATTERN, DESCRIBE THE FACTS OF THIS CASE FOR THE COURT.SHE WILL ALSO ADDRESS HEARSAY OBJECTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. THE COURT HAD SOME QUESTION WITH REGARD TO THE ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE DEFINITION OF ABUSE, AND I WILL BE RESPONDING TO THAT SHORTLY.MR. UELMEN ARGUED THAT ABUSE MEANS ONLY PHYSICAL VIOLENCE WITHIN THE NOTION OF FAMILY CODE SECTION 6203.AGAIN, THIS IS WHERE IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT WHERE THESE TERMS COME FROM AND WHAT THEY ARE BEING USED FOR.THE TERM ""ABUSE"" WITHIN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS USED FOR A VARIETY OF CONTROLLED MECHANISMS AND BEHAVIORS. THE KIND OF ABUSE WHICH CONSTITUTES DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS INTIMIDATION, VERBAL ABUSE AS IN CONTROLLING A PERSON.WE HEARD EARLIER ABOUT VERBAL ABUSE, AND IT WAS JUST AN ARGUMENT OF THE KIND OF MITIGATING FACTS. THE KIND OF VERBAL ABUSE AND INTIMIDATION THAT WE SEE WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES IS BELITTLING THE VICTIM, CALLING HER NAMES, RUNNING HER DOWN.THE INCIDENTS THAT WE WILL BE HEARING ABOUT IN THIS CASE, TELLING HER SHE IS A BIG FAT PIG IN PUBLIC, GRABBING HER CROTCH, SAYING, ""THIS IS MINE. THIS IS WHERE MY CHILDREN COME FROM,"" THAT IS HUMILIATION, THAT IS CONTROL MECHANISMS, THAT IS VERBAL ABUSE, USING EMOTIONAL ABUSE.""EMOTIONAL ABUSE"" IS A TERM THAT IS RECOGNIZED IN THE LITERATURE THAT STARTED WITH LENORE WALKER AND HAS GONE THROUGH THE MAINSTREAM OF THE LITERATURE, EMOTIONAL ABUSE BEING CONTROL OF THE WOMAN THROUGH PUTTING HER DOWN, TELLING HER SHE'S CRAZY, MITIGATING WHAT OCCURS WITHIN THE HOME, INCONSISTENT BEHAVIORS, THE KIND OF EXPLOSIVE RAGE WITH NO PATTERN. THAT'S EMOTIONAL ABUSE AND IT'S PART OF THE CONTROL CYCLE.ISOLATION; CUTTING A WOMAN OFF FROM HER SUPPORT SYSTEMS, SUPPORT SYSTEMS THAT ANYONE NEEDS WITHIN THE WORLD, LIMITING HER FRIENDS WHO SHE CAN SEE, WHO SHE CAN TALK TO, WHAT CLOTHES SHE CAN WEAR, CAN SHE WORK OUT OF THE HOME, JUST THE KIND OF THINGS THAT WERE DONE IN THIS CASE.MINIMIZING -- DENYING, MINIMIZING THE VIOLENCE, THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THIS CASE. IT IS SOMETHING WHICH IS CLASSIC WITHIN AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP, FOR THE BATTERER TO MINIMIZE WHAT HAS OCCURRED.""IT'S JUST A FAMILY PROBLEM. IT WAS NO BIG THING. WE WERE JUST ARGUING. WE WERE WRESTLING. WE HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK AND IT JUST KIND OF GOT OUT OF HAND,"" SAME KIND OF ARGUMENTS WE HEARD TO -- EXACTLY THE KIND OF BEHAVIORS THAT A BATTERER EXISTS.USING CHILDREN, THREATENING TO TAKE AWAY CHILDREN, THREATENING TO SOMEHOW AFFECT IN -- ESPECIALLY IN DIVORCE, CUSTODIAL RIGHTS, THREATENING TO AFFECT A WOMAN'S FINANCIAL STATE OF WELL-BEING SO SHE CAN'T SUPPORT HER KIDS OR TAKE CARE OF THEM, WRITING HER A LETTER TELLING HER SHE'S GOING TO GO TO JAIL AND TAKE OUT -- TAKE AWAY ALL THE MONEY THAT SHE HAS, TAKE AWAY HER ABILITY TO SUPPORT HER CHILDREN.USING MALE PRIVILEGE; IT IS MAKING ALL THE DECISIONS, NOT GIVING HER A ROLE WITHIN THE RELATIONSHIP, BEING THE MASTER OF THE CASTLE, THE CENTER OF ATTENTION, THE PERSON THAT WHENEVER ANYONE GOES -- WHEREVER YOU GO, THE ATTENTION HAS TO CENTER AROUND THE BATTERER, JUST AS IN THIS CASE.ECONOMIC ABUSE, USING MONEY AS A CONTROLLING MECHANISM, DECIDING HOW MUCH MONEY SHE COULD HAVE, MAKING SURE SHE DOESN'T WORK, THREATENING TO TAKE MONEY AWAY FROM HER THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE AND USING COERCION AND THREATS, PHYSICAL THREATS, ""I'M GOING TO HURT YOU, I'M GOING TO KILL YOU, I'M GOING TO BEAT YOU.""THOSE ARE ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF ABUSE, DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONDUCT, DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONDUCT THAT WE SEE IN THIS CASE. THEY ABSOLUTELY ARE SIMILAR AND THEY ABSOLUTELY ARE LINKED. AND HOW THEY ARE SIMILAR AND LINKED IS BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL BEHAVIORS OF CONTROL, THEY ARE ALL BEHAVIORS OF POWER.AND IMPRINTED ON TOP OF ALL THESE IS ""PHYSICAL VIOLENCE.""AND LATER IN THE PRESENTATION, WHEN I'M DISCUSSING BATTERED WOMAN'S SYNDROME, I WILL EXPLAIN THIS MORE WITH REGARD TO WHAT THAT COMMONLY MEANS IS POWER AND CONTROL, WHICH WILL EXPLAIN THE INTERRELATIONSHIP OF THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF ABUSES.MR. GOLDBERG WILL THEN ADDRESS THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THIS EVIDENCE UNDER CERTAIN THEORIES OF ADMISSIBILITY, THE LEGAL ARGUMENTS, TALK ABOUT THE TRANSACTIONAL ANALYSIS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT, WHY THIS LEGALLY -- THIS NOTION, SUPPORT OF THIS EVIDENCE COMING IN AS PART OF THIS TRANSACTION OF THIS HOMICIDE.HOWEVER, IT ALSO COMES IN UNDER TRADITIONALLY 1101(B). WE WILL ADDRESS DUE PROCESS CONCERNS THAT WERE ADDRESSED IN OUR BRIEF, BUT NOT ADDRESSED TODAY IN ARGUMENTS AND DEAL WITH SOME OF THE ISSUES UNDER 352.WE'LL THEN ADDRESS THE COURT THEN WITH USE OF EXPERT TESTIMONY IN CASES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SPECIFICALLY 1107 OF THE EVIDENCE CODE.AND JUST A FOOTNOTE ON THAT. I WILL GET INTO MORE DETAIL.IT MUST BE KEPT IN MIND, 1107 IS NOT A STATUTE WHICH WAS INTENDED TO BE AN EXCLUSIONARY DEVICE. IT WAS A STATUTE WHICH BECAME THE GENESIS, THE SEED. ITS DEVELOPMENT WAS A STATUTE WHICH WOULD BRING THIS EVIDENCE BEFORE THE LIGHT OF DAY.1107 STARTED FROM CASES IN WHICH A WOMAN HAD KILLED HER BATTERER, AND THE DEFENDANT SOUGHT TO BRING THIS EVIDENCE IN TO EXPLAIN HER CONDUCT. AS MR. UELMEN SAID, IT BASICALLY AROSE AROUND THE TIME ARIS WAS DECIDED.NOW, WE WILL TALK ABOUT ARIS BECAUSE I ACTUALLY DISAGREE WITH HIS INTERPRETATION A BIT. AND I CERTAINLY WILL ADDRESS THAT, BUT THIS RULE AROSE AS A RESULT OF INCLUSION.LOOKING AT THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF THIS STATUTE -- MISS BODIN WILL ADDRESS THAT. SHE WAS PART OF THAT LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, WAS PRESENT FOR EVERY HEARING ON IT, IN FACT WROTE SEVERAL OF THE ADDENDUMS TO THAT STATUTE, WAS ACTUALLY PART OF IT.WHAT WAS CLEAR FROM THAT LEGISLATURE INTENT WAS THAT THIS WAS A STATUTE OF INCLUSION. IT SPECIFICALLY IS STATED WITHIN THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT OF THAT STATUTE, WITHIN THE AUTHOR'S INTENT THAT HE DID NOT INTEND TO ABROGATE ANY STANDING CASE LAW OR OTHER STATUTORY DECISION WITH REGARD TO THE INCLUSION OF BATTERED WOMAN'S SYNDROME EVIDENCE.SO THE NOTION THAT 1107 SOMEHOW NARROWS WHAT OTHER CASE LAW WE HAVE OUT THERE, THAT IS NOT BEHIND THAT STATUTE. IF THERE WERE OTHER METHODS WITHIN WHICH TO INTRODUCE THIS EVIDENCE BEYOND 1107, THEY STAND.BUT THE PROHIBITION IN 1107 IS LINKED DIRECTLY TO BLEDSOE AND BALKER AND THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT WHICH PROVIDES THE COURT WITH AN ANALOGOUS, JUST LIMITED TO BLEDSOE AND BALKER, THAT PROHIBITION OF CERTAIN TYPE OF EVIDENCE IS LIMITED TO ONE THING.AND THAT'S THE KIND OF EXCLUSION THAT THERE IS IN BLEDSOE WITH RAPE TRAUMA SYNDROME OR BALKER AND CHILD ACCOMMODATION SYNDROME WHERE WHAT I AM PROHIBITED FROM DOING AS A PROSECUTOR IS TO ASK A DOCTOR, ""HAVE YOU EXAMINED THE VICTIM; AND IF YOU HAVE, DO YOU THINK SHE WAS RAPED?""I CAN'T -- WE DON'T INTEND TO DO THAT, USE THE EVIDENCE THAT TYPE OF WAY. THAT IS THE LIMITATION THAT IS PLACED ON BATTERED WOMAN'S SYNDROME UNDER 1107. TO SUGGEST THAT IT'S GREATER THAN THAT, TO SUGGEST THAT IT GOES FARTHER THAN THAT IS NOT WITHIN THE CASE LAW OR THE STATUTES OR THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT.AS THIS CASE HAS PROGRESSED, WE HAVE DEALT WITH A LOT OF BRAND NEW ISSUES IN THE LAW, ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TO PRESENTING EVIDENCE, ISSUES WITH REGARD TO PUBLIC ACCESS TO TRIALS.IN FACT, IN MANY WAYS, WHAT IS OCCURRING WITHIN THIS TRIAL AND THE WAY THAT THIS TRIAL IS BEING PRESENTED PERCEIVED BY THE PUBLIC WILL TAKE US INTO PROBABLY THE 21ST CENTURY AS TO WHAT WILL OCCUR IN TRIAL, AND WE'RE SETTING THE PRECEDENCE. AND THAT IS SOMETHING CERTAINLY TO BE APPLAUDED. AS WE DO THAT, WE CERTAINLY CANNOT DO THAT WITH 19TH CENTURY SENSIBILITIES.WOMEN HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE THEIR ABUSE HAS BEEN KEPT IN THE SHADOWS. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND WHAT OCCURS TO A WOMAN, ONE OF THE DYNAMICS OF THAT ENTIRE STRUGGLE IS ONE OF SECRECY, SHADOWS AND VEIL. IT CERTAINLY HAS TO BE BROUGHT OUT INTO THE LIGHT AT SOME POINT.AND WHEN WE HAVE A STATE OF THE LAW WHERE THE STATE OF THE LAW IS, THAT IS SO CLEAR THAT WHEN A WOMEN HAS KILLED HER BATTERER, THAT THAT EVIDENCE MUST COME IN, IT'S REVERSIBLE EVIDENCE ERROR FOR IT NOT TO COME IN, THEN CERTAINLY IF THAT GROUP OF WOMEN NEED TO BE PROTECTED BY THAT EVIDENCE COMING IN, AS IT WELL SHOULD, THEN WOMEN THAT HAVE BEEN KILLED BY THEIR BATTERERS CERTAINLY NEED TO HAVE THE COURT OR THE TRIER OF FACT LISTEN TO THAT EVIDENCE TO MAKE THE PROPER JUDGMENT.PEOPLE VERSUS DAY, VERY RECENT CASE WHICH INTERPRETED 1107, THE COURT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED THAT WHEN IT SAID THAT -- I GOT A CITE FOR THE COURT -- 2 CAL. APP. 4 409 -- WHERE IT TALKED ABOUT THE TRIER OF FACT, IN MANY CASES, HAS THE JUROR SITTING THERE, HAVE NEVER BEEN RAPED, HAVE NOT LIVED WITHIN A BATTERER -- AS A BATTERED PERSON, HAVE NO PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH CHILD ABUSE. AND FOR THEM TO UNDERSTAND WHAT OCCURS IN THAT CASE, THEY NEED TO HEAR EXPERT TESTIMONY WHICH EXPLAINS IT.IN FACT, THE COURT GOES ON TO SAY IN THAT CASE THAT:""DEPRIVING THE FINDER OF FACT OF SUCH UNDERSTANDING MAY WELL LEAD TO A CONCLUSION BASED ON MISCONCEPTIONS UPHELD IN GOOD FAITH, THAT SUCH CONCEPTIONS ARE HELD IN GOOD FAITH AND NO WAY LESSENS THE MAGNITUDE OF THE ERROR AND THE INJUSTICE THAT WILL RESULT.""WHAT WILL BE DEMONSTRATED FROM THIS ARGUMENT IS THAT UNDER THE FACTS THAT WE HAVE HERE, THE LEGAL ANALYSIS AND THE POLICY AND LEGAL ANALYSIS WITH REGARD TO EXPERT TESTIMONY, IT WILL BECOME CLEAR THAT THE HISTORY OF ABUSE, THE PATTERN OF ABUSE SUFFERED BY THE VICTIM, NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, IN THIS CASE MUST COME INTO THIS TRIAL.THERE WAS A MOTIVE FOR THIS KILLING, AND THIS MOTIVE WAS THE SAME MOTIVE WHICH IS PRESENT IN THE MAJORITY OF SPOUSAL, WIFE KILLINGS; AND THAT IS ONE OF ESTRANGEMENT AND JEALOUSY.THAT IS CLEARLY WHAT THE MOTIVE IS IN THIS CASE.WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT TEXTBOOK TYPES OF CASES, DRUG CASES, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES. THAT IS A TEXTBOOK MOTIVE, AND WE HAVE A DUTY AS PROSECUTORS TO PROVE MOTIVE. THE EVIDENCE THAT WE DESCRIBED HERE TODAY PROVES THAT.WE HAVE A DUTY AS PROSECUTORS TO PROVE INTENT. WE WILL PROVE INTENT; AND THE INTENT THAT WE WILL PROVE IS THE INTENT TO CONTROL, THE INTENT THAT WAS PRESENT THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THIS RELATIONSHIP, THE CONTROL THAT STARTED ON A FAIRLY LOW LEVEL, THAT STARTED WITH DECIDING WHO SHE COULD SEE, WHAT SHE COULD WEAR, WHERE SHE COULD GO, CONTROL THAT ESCALATED WITH PUBLIC HUMILIATION, PHYSICAL VIOLENCE, PROPERTY DESTRUCTION, VERY SPECIFIC PROPERTY DESTRUCTION, WHICH IS CALLED SYMBOLIC VIOLENCE, DESTROYING THE PICTURES OF HER FAMILY, POSSESSIONS THAT WERE VERY CLOSE TO HER.IT ESCALATES.AT ONE POINT, SHE ATTEMPTED TO GET AWAY. AND WHEN SHE DID, SHE FINALLY DID SOMETHING WHICH MARKED IN THIS DEFENDANT'S MIND THAT THE RELATIONSHIP WAS OVER.AND IT'S VERY COMMON IN THESE RELATIONSHIPS THAT THE DEFENDANT IS OF THE MIND SET THAT, ""I CONTROL THIS WOMAN. SHE IS MINE. I HAVE TO HAVE HER. SHE IS THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE WORLD FOR ME. I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT HER. IF I CAN'T HAVE HER, NO ONE WILL.""THOSE ARE STATEMENTS WHICH ARE CLASSIC IN THESE TYPES OF CASES. THEY ARE STATEMENTS THAT ARE HERE.AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THAT MESSAGE FINALLY GETS CLEAR -- THROUGH TO THE BATTERER, THAT HE CAN'T HAVE HER ANYMORE, THAT SHE IS FINALLY GOING TO ESCAPE THIS CYCLE, SHE'S FINALLY BUILT UP THE COURAGE TO GO, THAT THE CONTROL DOESN'T -- THE ACTS OF CONTROL THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON AND ESCALATING DON'T WORK ANYMORE. THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER CONTROL MECHANISM THAT COMES INTO PLACE, BECAUSE IF HE CAN'T HAVE HER, NO ONE WILL.AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THE ESTRANGEMENT, THE JEALOUSY COMES UP, WELLS UP WITHIN HIM AND THERE HAS TO BE A MECHANISM, CONTROL EMPLOYED. AND THAT LAST AND TERMINAL MECHANISM OF CONTROL, THAT WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BATTERER CAN HAVE HER AND NO ONE ELSE WILL IS TO KILL HER.THAT IS CLEAR IN THE RESEARCH. IT IS CLEAR IN THE SCIENCES THAT WORK WITH BATTERERS. IT IS CLEAR IN THE SOCIAL POLICY. IT IS WHY SOME OF THE LEGISLATORS HAVE ENACTED STRONG STATUTES TO INTERVENE BATTERING IN A VERY LOW END TO PREVENT HOMICIDES. IT IS CLEAR FROM THE FACTS OF THIS CASE.YOUR HONOR, EVERY YEAR, AS WE HAVE HEARD, THERE ARE AT LEAST 2.5 MILLION WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES THAT ARE AFFECTED BY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HAS RECENTLY REPORTED THAT ABOUT 35 -- BETWEEN 22 PERCENT AND 35 PERCENT OF THE WOMEN VISITING EMERGENCY ROOMS EVERY YEAR ARE DOING SO BECAUSE OF AN INSTANT OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.MANY OF THESE WOMEN ARE INJURED AND KILLED BECAUSE THEIR VIOLENCE STAYS SECRET. THE VIOLENCE THAT OCCURS TO THEM STAYS IN THE SHADOW.NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON WAS ONE OF THESE WOMEN. AND UP UNTIL TODAY, UP UNTIL THIS TRIAL, HER ABUSE HAS BEEN HIDDEN TOO JUST LIKE IT IS WITH SO MANY OTHER WOMEN.NOW, AT LEAST AT THAT POINT WHERE HER BATTERER IS ON TRIAL FOR KILLING HER, THAT EVIDENCE WHICH EXPLAINS HER LIFE, EXPLAINS WHAT HAPPENED TO HER AND EXPLAINS WHY SHE WAS KILLED GOES TO THE HEART OF THE PEOPLE'S CASE, GOES TO THE HEART OF WHAT OCCURRED IN THIS RELATIONSHIP AND IS THE TRUTH. AND AS ZACK SAYS, THE PROCESS OF A TRIAL IS TO SEEK THE TRUTH, NOT PART OF IT, BUT ALL OF IT.

#MS. BODIN: ,"YOUR HONOR, I'M GOING TO MAKE A FACTUAL PRESENTATION WITH REGARD TO THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE. I APPRECIATE THE COURT GIVING US A LIST OF ACTS. IT IS EXTREMELY HELPFUL AND BASICALLY COMPORTED WHAT WE HAD ALREADY SET UP FOR OURSELVES, AND I'M GOING TO TRY TO ANSWER THAT.SPECIFICALLY, THE COURT HAD ASKED US TO ADDRESS LEGAL THEORIES. AS I GO THROUGH MY ARGUMENT AND TALK ABOUT THE FACTS THAT ARE SPOKEN OF IN OUR BRIEF AND OF COURSE THE NEW ACTS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IN OUR ADDENDUM, I AM GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE LEGAL THEORIES THAT UNDER PIN -- UNDER PIN, THE ADMISSION OF THESE ACTS.THE STATEMENT OF FACTS THAT I'M GOING TO MAKE TO THE COURT TODAY STARTS IN 1977 UNTIL THE TIME OF THE MURDER OF THE VICTIM BY THE DEFENDANT. THE ACTS OF ABUSE THAT WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT WILL INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:OBSESSIVE AND JEALOUS BEHAVIOR, PUBLIC HUMILIATION OF THE VICTIM, FINANCIAL MANIPULATION, THREATS OF VIOLENCE, ACTUAL PHYSICAL VIOLENCE, STALKING AND FINALLY THE MURDER ITSELF.THERE IS AN IMPRESSIVE BODY OF LITERATURE AND RESEARCH THAT HAS LOOKED INTO THE ISSUE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND IN LAW, THERE IS EQUALLY AN IMPRESSIVE BODY OF LAW THAT LOOKS AT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.THE TYPES OF ACTS THAT I HAVE JUST DESCRIBED TO THE COURT ARE ACTS THAT HAVE BEEN WELL ADDRESSED IN THE CASE LAW.WITH REGARD TO PROPERTY DESTRUCTION -- AND THESE ARE CITED IN OUR BRIEF -- THERE ARE TWO CASES, HELFEN AND HAYLOCK.AND THOSE CASES TALK ABOUT PROPERTY DESTRUCTION. BOTH OF THEM TALK ABOUT ARSON. AND WHAT THE COURT SAID IN BOTH OF THOSE CASES IS THAT PROPERTY DESTRUCTION GOES TO MOTIVE.PHYSICAL VIOLENCE IS DISCUSSED IN ZACK. THERE'S LOTS OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE IN THE FACT PATTERN THAT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT AND SPECIFICALLY THAT GOES TO IDENTITY A PERMISSIBLE 1101(B) PURPOSE, AS IS MOTIVE.STALKING, IT'S TALKED ABOUT IN THE NICHOLAS CASE. AND PARTICULARLY STALKING AND STARING WHICH WE SEE IN THIS CASE, AND IN THE NICHOLAS CASE, THE COURT SAYS THAT GOES TO PREMEDITATION, WHICH WE HAVE TO PROVE IN THIS CASE.POSSESSIVENESS AND JEALOUSY GOES TO MOTIVE. AND THERE ARE THREE CASES CITED IN OUR BRIEF THAT TALK ABOUT THAT IN A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CONTEXT. THOSE THREE CASES ARE THE DUMAS CASE, WHERE THE DEFENDANT STATED, ""IF I CAN'T HAVE YOU, NOBODY ELSE CAN.""THAT UNFORTUNATELY BECOMES AN ECHO IN THIS CASE.THE SHAVER CASE, WHERE THE DEFENDANT ACCUSED THE VICTIM AND ULTIMATELY MURDERED HER -- ACCUSED HER OF BEING WITH OTHER MEN AND ULTIMATELY KILLED HER BECAUSE OF IT.AND THE DANIELS CASE, WHICH TALKS ABOUT JEALOUSY, QUARRELS AND ENMITY, WHICH AGAIN UNFORTUNATELY IS A VERY FAMILIAR THEME IN THE FACT PATTERN I'M ABOUT TO DESCRIBE TO THIS COURT.AND FINALLY, FINANCIAL MANIPULATION. AND THAT IS DISCUSSED IN THE ARGENTOS CASE, WHICH IS NOT A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE, BUT TALKS ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO GOLD MINERS.RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE IS NOT LIMITED MERELY TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND THE CASE LAW IN CALIFORNIA BEGINNING IN THE EARLY 1920'S IS REPLETE WITH CASES INVOLVING RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE. WE'VE CITED THEM IN OUR BRIEF AND I'VE CITED SOME OF THEM TO THE COURT.NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON MET THE DEFENDANT IN 1977. THE PHYSICAL VIOLENCE IN THIS RELATIONSHIP BEGAN EARLY. IN FACT, IT BEGAN IMMEDIATELY, BECAUSE WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT IN 1977 OR 1978, THERE WAS A VERY LOUD ARGUMENT OVERHEARD BY THEIR NEIGHBORS ON ASHTON STREET.THE NEIGHBORS WERE CONNIE AND STEVEN GOOD. THE PEOPLE HAVE CONDUCTED AN INTERVIEW WITH MS. GOOD. MS. GOOD STATES THAT SHE REMEMBERS THE INCIDENT VERY WELL. AND WHAT SHE REMEMBERS IS THIS:SHE COULD HEAR ARGUING. SHE COULD HEAR THE DEFENDANT YELLING AND CALLING THE VICTIM NAMES. SPECIFICALLY, HE CALLED HER A FUCKING BITCH AND A MOTHER FUCKER.SHE KNEW THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE. SHE HAD HEARD IT BEFORE AROUND THE APARTMENT. SHE HAD HEARD IT IN AN ELEVATOR AND THAT IT HAD A UNIQUE SOUND. SHE HEARD THUMPING AND THE VOICE OF A FEMALE CRYING.A DAY OR TWO LATER, SHE SAW THE VICTIM AND THE DEFENDANT IN AN ELEVATOR, AND THE VICTIM HAD TWO BLACK EYES.MR. UELMEN HAS ARGUED THAT BECAUSE THIS HAPPENED SO LONG AGO, THAT THIS IS ATTENUATED, THAT IT COULDN'T POSSIBLY HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE MURDER.THERE IS A THEME OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE. AND I'LL KEEP ON TALKING ABOUT THIS AS I GO THROUGH THE STATEMENT OF FACTS, THAT WE HAVE STEALTH THROUGH THIS STATEMENT OF FACTS AND THROUGH THE LIFE OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON THAT IS CONSISTENT, THAT IS VICIOUS, THAT ESCALATED TO OTHER FORMS OF ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR AND IT IS BUT THE PRELUDE TO WHAT ULTIMATELY WAS A HOMICIDE. IT SHOWS THE START OF A LONG HISTORY OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.THERE ARE DIARY ENTRIES THAT MR. UELMEN HAS ALLUDED TO IN HIS ARGUMENT. SPECIFICALLY, THERE IS A DIARY ENTRY WITH REGARD TO A TIME IN 1977 WHERE THE DEFENDANT SLAMMED THE VICTIM INTO A WALL. AND THERE WAS A WITNESS TO THAT, AND THAT WITNESS WAS AL COWLINGS.NEXT, THERE IS AN ENTRY IN THAT DOCUMENT, THAT DIARY, WITH REGARD TO A TRIP TO NEW YORK WHERE THE DEFENDANT PUBLICLY SLAPPED HER AND CALLED HER MOTHER A WHORE, AND SHE HAD CALLED FOR HELP ON THE STREET.THERE IS AN INCIDENT IN 1982 WHERE THE VICTIM WENT TO A FRIEND OF THE DEFENDANT'S BY THE NAME OF WAYNE HUGHES.MR. UELMEN HAS STATED THAT IS RANK HEARSAY. WE HAVE A WITNESS. THEY HAVE COPIES OF OUR INTERVIEW WITH THAT WITNESS, THAT IS MR. WAYNE HUGHES, WITH REGARD TO NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON COMING TO HIS HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WITH A RED SPOT BEGGING HIM TO TALK TO THE DEFENDANT ABOUT THE DEFENDANT'S PHYSICAL VIOLENCE TOWARDS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON. SHE WAS EXTREMELY UPSET AND BORE THE MARKS OF VIOLENCE.IN 1978, THERE WAS AN INCIDENT THAT IS RECORDED IN THE DIARY WITH REGARD TO THE DEFENDANT HITTING HER IN THE WINE CELLAR AND LOCKING HER IN THERE. THERE WAS ALSO, IN THAT SAME DOCUMENT, A NOTATION WITH REGARD TO A SAN JOSE TRACK MEET WHERE HE BACKHANDED HER IN THE CAR AND THEN LEFT HER ON A ROADSIDE.AND FINALLY IN THAT DOCUMENT, THERE IS A MENTION OF A HIT THAT SHE TOOK, A BEATING THAT SHE TOOK BECAUSE THE DEFENDANT FOUND A NOTE THAT SHE WROTE TO HERSELF.NOW, MR. UELMEN HAS DISCUSSED THE PROBLEM -- HEARSAY PROBLEM OF GETTING IN DIARY ENTRIES. AND THAT'S WELL TAKEN. BUT I THINK THE DEFENSE SHOULD BE ON NOTICE THAT WE CERTAINLY ARE GOING TO CROSS-EXAMINE WITNESSES WHO THE DEFENSE PRESENT, PERHAPS THE DEFENDANT HIMSELF, WITH REGARD TO THESE INCIDENTS. WE PUT THEM IN TO SHOW THE COURT WHAT WE HAVE.FURTHERMORE, WE ARE HAVING OBVIOUSLY AN EXPERT LOOK AT THIS CASE AND WE ARE HAVING THE EXPERT USE THOSE INCIDENTS, THOSE DIARY INCIDENTS AS PART OF THE FOUNDATION FOR THE OPINION THAT THE EXPERT WILL FORM IN THIS CASE.FINALLY -- AND THE COURT KNOWS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT DISCOVERY IN THIS CASE, AND WE HAVE AN ON-GOING INVESTIGATION. IT HAS BEEN THE CASE WHERE WE HAVE HAD DIARY ENTRIES THAT HAVE FINALLY BEEN CORROBORATED BY KNOWN WITNESSES. AND THAT'S OCCURRED A NUMBER OF TIMES IN THIS CASE.AND SO WE DID INCLUDE THEM IN OUR STATEMENT OF FACTS AND WE DID WANT TO PUT EVERYBODY ON NOTICE THAT WE DID HAVE THEM AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO INVESTIGATE THEM.IN 1978, THERE WAS AN INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED AT THE LA CANTINA -- I GUESS -- IT IS A BAR I THINK AS CHARACTERIZED BY MR. UELMEN.IN 1978, NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, THE DEFENDANT, DENISE BROWN AND ED MC CABE WENT TO LA CANTINA WHERE THEY CONTINUED THEIR GET-TOGETHER BACK TO THE ROCKINGHAM ADDRESS.BACK AT THE ROCKINGHAM ADDRESS, THEY WERE TALKING, HAVING A SOCIAL OCCASION, DENISE BROWN COMMENTED THAT O.J. TOOK NICOLE FOR GRANTED. IT WAS A SIMPLE STATEMENT.THE DEFENDANT LITERALLY THREW A FIT. WHAT HE DID WAS, HE THREW THEM ALL OUT OF THE HOUSE, HE SLAMMED NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON INTO A WALL, HE THREW HER OUT THE DOOR FROM A FOYER ENTRANCE AND HE BROKE ALL THE FAMILY PICTURES.WE HAVE AN EYEWITNESS TO THIS.IT DOES SHOW A LONG HISTORY OF QUARRELING AND A PHYSICAL ABUSE AGAIN IN 1978, WHERE ONCE AGAIN, PICKING UP THE THREAD OF PHYSICAL ABUSE. WE'RE ALSO PICKING UP THE THREAD NOW OF PROPERTY DAMAGE, DESTROYING FAMILY PICTURES.IN 1983 TO 1984, WE HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH A WOMAN WHO WORKED FOR THE SIMPSON'S BY THE NAME OF MARIA BAUR.THERE WAS A STATEMENT TAKEN FROM HER THAT SHE OBSERVED NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON WALKING DOWN THE DRIVEWAY LITERALLY HOLDING HERSELF AND CRYING. MARIA INQUIRED OF HER, ""WHAT'S WRONG, NICOLE?"" AND SHE SAID, ""YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW. YOU DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED."" AND WHEN MARIA WENT INTO THE HOUSE, SHE FOUND GLASS ALL UP AND DOWN THE STAIRS, AND SHE CLEANED IT UP.IN FACT, THERE IS A CONSISTENT THEME THROUGHOUT THIS FACT PATTERN THAT THE DEFENDANT LIKES TO DESTROY PHOTOS OF THE VICTIM. HE DESTROYS FAMILY PHOTOS, A FORM OF HUMILIATION, A FORM OF DEGRADATION, A DESTRUCTION OF CHERISHED MOMENTOES, THINGS THAT ARE BORNE CLOSE TO THE HEART, THINGS THAT REALLY MEAN SOMETHING, THINGS THAT PERHAPS COULD BE REPLACED MONETARILY, BUT THE SENTIMENTAL VALUE IS EXCESSIVE TO A PERSON.BY 1986, THE VICTIM IS RELATING IN HER DIARY THAT SHE HAD GONE OUT FOR AN EVENING WITH SOME FRIENDS, GOT IN AN ARGUMENT AND THE DEFENDANT BEAT HER. THERE IS MEDICAL EVIDENCE FROM THIS INCIDENT FROM DR. MARTIN ALPERT.WHAT THE VICTIM RELATED WAS THAT SHE HAD HAD A BICYCLE ACCIDENT. THE DOCTOR SAYS THAT BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE INJURY, THE TYPE OF INJURY THAT SHE SUSTAINED, IT WAS IMPLAUSIBLE TO BELIEVE THAT SHE HAD A BICYCLE ACCIDENT.WHAT WE KNOW -- AND IF AN EXPERT WILL TESTIFY AND SHOULD TESTIFY IN A CASE INVOLVING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE -- IS THAT VERY FREQUENTLY, VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DO NOT REPORT HOW THEY OBTAIN THEIR INJURY. THEY'RE AFRAID TO DO IT AND THEY'RE PARTICULARLY AFRAID TO DO IT WHEN THEY'RE ACCOMPANIED FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT BY THEIR BATTERER.AND THAT IS TRUE IN THIS CASE. SHE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY THE DEFENDANT FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT.ONCE AGAIN, AN INCIDENT OF PHYSICAL ABUSE AND SHOWING ONCE AGAIN CONTINUOUS CONDUCT INVOLVING PHYSICAL ABUSE.BY 1985 -- AND IN 1985, WE HAVE AN INCIDENT INVOLVING THE SMASHING OF A WHITE MERCEDEZ THAT BELONGED TO THE VICTIM. WE HAVE TWO ACCOUNTS OF THIS.MR. UELMEN STATED THAT THE ONLY ACCOUNT OF THIS IS THROUGH THE MEMORANDUM WRITTEN BY DETECTIVE MARK FUHRMAN. THAT IS SIMPLY NOT SO, THAT HE HAS MISCHARACTERIZED THE FACTS TO THIS COURT.WE HAVE ANOTHER REPORT BY AN INDIVIDUAL BY THE NAME OF SERGEANT MARK DAY, WHO AT THAT TIME IN 1985 WORKED FOR WESTEC SECURITY, AND HE RESPONDED TO THE INCIDENT. HE'S WRITTEN A REPORT. THE DEFENSE HAS IT.WE HAVE ANOTHER WITNESS BESIDES DETECTIVE MARK FUHRMAN.AND I MIGHT ALSO ADD THAT THERE IS A CHALLENGE IN THIS HEARING TO THE CREDIBILITY OF DETECTIVE FUHRMAN. CREDIBILITY IS NOT AN ISSUE IN A 402 HEARING.BUT WE DO HAVE WITNESSES ON THIS ISSUE AND WE HAVE EYEWITNESSES ON THIS ISSUE. ONCE AGAIN, AN EXAMPLE OF PROPERTY DAMAGE, A DESTRUCTION OF WHAT PROBABLY WAS A STATUS SYMBOL OF A BELOVED OBJECT TO A BATTERED WOMAN.IN 1988, THERE IS AN -- EXCUSE ME -- THERE IS AN INCIDENT RECANTED IN THE DIARY, AND IT WAS WITNESSED BY DENISE BROWN, WHEREIN THE DEFENDANT BECAME ANGRY BECAUSE NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON ALLOWED A GAY MAN TO KISS HER CHILD.AND WHAT DENISE SAW WAS THAT THE DEFENDANT GOT MAD, YELLED AT NICOLE MERELY BECAUSE SHE LET A STRANGER KISS HER BABY BECAUSE THE MAN THOUGHT THAT HER CHILD WAS CUTE, AND NICOLE LEFT THE CAR THAT THEY WERE RIDING IN AND HAD TO RIDE BACK TO THE HOTEL WITH HER PARENTS.DENISE ALSO RELATES THAT DURING THE COURSE OF THEIR VACATION IN HAWAII, NICOLE WORE A BATHING SUIT COVER-UP. NICOLE REPORTS IN HER DIARY THAT SHE HAD BEEN BEATEN UP TO THE EXTENT THAT SHE WAS WEARING THAT COVER-UP.IN 1988, NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON RECORDS IN A THREE-PAGE LETTER THAT SHE HAD SCHEDULED AN OUTING FOR HERSELF AND HER CHILDREN TO ""DISNEY ON ICE"". THIS WAS A TIME WHEN SHE WAS TWO MONTHS' PREGNANT. SHE HAD ASKED THE DEFENDANT IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO WITH HER AND SHE BELIEVED THAT HE WAS WILLING TO GO.BY THE TIME THAT IT CAME TIME TO ACTUALLY GO TO ""DISNEY ON ICE"", HE DIDN'T WANT TO GO. AND SO SHE JUST SIMPLY TOOK THE CHILDREN AND WENT WITH HER MOTHER AND HER SISTER, DOMINIQUE, BY HERSELF WITH THE CHILDREN, LEAVING THE DEFENDANT TO DO WHATEVER HE WAS DOING.WHEN SHE GOT HOME, HE BEGAN TO DENIGRATE HER. HE BEGAN TO CALL HER A FAT SLOB, TO CALL HER A PIG.WHEN SHE WAS TWO MONTHS' PREGNANT, HE MADE HER LEAVE THE HOUSE WITH SIDNEY, HER CHILD, AND TOLD HER OVER THE PHONE THAT HE HAD A GUN.AND WE KNOW OF COURSE THAT THE DEFENDANT HAS A GUN COLLECTION. THAT OCCURS IN THE FACT PATTERN.AND THEN AL COWLINGS WAS PRESENT FOR A PART OF IT, THAT HE SORT OF TOOK CHARGE OF SIDNEY SO THAT NICOLE COULD LEAVE THE ROOM AND THE DEFENDANT COULD FOLLOW HER OUT, DENIGRATING HER THE WHOLE TIME.THERE IS AN INCIDENT REPORTED IN 1986 TO 1987 BY AN INDIVIDUAL BY THE NAME OF ALBERT AGUILARA -- AND THAT OCCURS IN OUR ADDENDUM THAT WE FILED -- WHERE HE SEES NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON GET HIT BY THE DEFENDANT AT VICTORIA BEACH.IT APPEARED TO HIM THAT THEY WERE SIMPLY PLAYING, NICOLE WAS TEASING THE DEFENDANT ON THE BEACH, AND THEN HE JUST BASICALLY REACHED UP AND SLAPPED HER IN THE FACE.ONCE AGAIN OF COURSE, I'M SURE THERE'S AN ARGUMENT THAT THERE'S ATTENUATION IN TIME. BUT ONCE AGAIN, I WOULD REITERATE TO THE COURT THAT IT REINFORCES ONCE AGAIN THE PATTERNS OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE, THE CONSISTENT THEME THAT RUNS THROUGHOUT THIS CASE.AND THEN WE GET TO 1989, NEW YEAR'S DAY.THERE IS A 911 TAPE THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE, THE DEFENSE HAS WHEREIN IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE TAPE, YOU CAN HEAR A WOMAN SCREAMING. THE POLICE REPORT TO THE HOUSE ON ROCKINGHAM.OFFICER EDWARDS FROM THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT GETS THERE, AND HE CALLS AND SAYS, YOU KNOW, ""WHAT'S GOING ON? WHO'S SCREAMING? I'M NOT GOING TO LEAVE HERE UNTIL I FIND OUT WHO'S SCREAMING."" HE'S TOLD SIMPLY TO GO AWAY PRESUMABLY BY THE HOUSEKEEPER MICHELLE.AND WHILE HE'S THERE, NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON RUNS OUT WEARING ONLY A PAIR OF SWEAT PANTS AND A BRA. SHE YELLED OUT TO HIM, ""HE'S GOING TO KILL ME.""IT WAS CLEAR TO OFFICER EDWARDS THAT SHE HAD BEEN BEATEN UP.BOTH NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON AND THE DEFENDANT TELL THE POLICE THAT THEY HAD BEEN OUT THERE AT LEAST EIGHT TIMES BEFORE. THE DEFENDANT TELLS THE POLICE THAT THIS WAS A FAMILY MATTER. AND IN FACT, WHAT HE DID WAS, HE FOLLOWED HER OUT THERE.AFTER THE TIME THAT THE POLICE SAW HER RUNNING OUT SAYING, ""HE'S GOING TO KILL ME,"" THEN THE DEFENDANT ARRIVES IN A BATHROBE. AND INSTEAD OF ADDRESSING THE POLICE, WHAT HE DOES IS, HE STARTS YELLING AT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, SUCH THAT THE POLICE HAVE TO GIVE HER A JACKET AND LET HER SIT IN THE POLICE CAR.WE HAVE PICTURES OF THAT INCIDENT THAT WERE TAKEN BY THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT.MR. UELMEN HAS CHARACTERIZED THIS AS A BEDROOM ARGUMENT, SOME SLAPPING AND SOME HITTING. ONE PICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS, AND I'LL NOW SHOW THAT PICTURE TO THE COURT.

WE ALSO HAVE A SWORN DEPOSITION WHEREIN THE DEFENDANT ADOPTS HIS LETTER WITH REGARD TO THE PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT.THERE IS ALSO A TAPE OF THE DEFENDANT TALKING ABOUT THIS INCIDENT ON ESPN, AND HE HAD A CONVERSATION WITH AN OFFICER FARRELL OF THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT BASICALLY ADOPTING THE FACT THAT THIS HAD OCCURRED.NOW, THERE HAS BEEN SOME QUESTION WITH REGARD TO THE PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO GET IN THE STATEMENTS THAT WERE MADE IN THIS CASE BY THE VICTIM. AND I MIGHT ADD, WE WOULD LIKE TO GET IN SOME STATEMENTS BY THE DEFENDANT IN THIS CASE BECAUSE HE COMES OUT -- HE'S ROARING AT HER WHEN HE COMES OUT THERE.AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS TRANSACTION, AND I WOULD LIKE THE COURT -- AND WE DO TALK ABOUT IT IN OUR BRIEF -- TO LOOK AT THE CASE OF PEOPLE VERSUS FARMER.BASICALLY THAT IS A CASE THAT TALKS ABOUT HEARSAY EXCEPTION AND EXCITED UTTERANCE PURSUANT TO EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 1240.WHAT THAT CASE STANDS FOR IS THAT THE CRUCIAL ELEMENTS WITH REGARD TO WHETHER OR NOT THIS TYPE OF HEARSAY STATEMENT IS ADMISSIBLE IS WHETHER THE MENTAL STATE OF THE SPEAKER IS THAT SUCH THAT THE STATEMENT IS BEING MADE UNDER THE STRESS THAT WAS PRODUCED BY THE EVENT.WE HAVE ALSO SHOWN IN OUR BRIEF THE CASE OF PEOPLE VERSUS WASHINGTON.PEOPLE VERSUS WASHINGTON BASICALLY LAYS OUT THE ELEMENTS OF 1240 AND STATES THAT IT MUST BE AN OCCURRENCE THAT IS STARTLING ENOUGH TO PRODUCE NERVOUS EXCITEMENT AND RENDER THE UTTERANCE SPONTANEOUS. THERE MUST BE ACTUAL NERVOUS EXCITEMENT AND IT MUST DOMINATE AT THE TIME OF THE UTTERANCE, AND THE UTTERANCE ITSELF MUST BE ABOUT THE STARTLING CIRCUMSTANCE.THE CASE OF PEOPLE V. HUEY STANDS FOR THE PROPOSITION THAT SUCH STATEMENTS MAY BE OFFERED TO PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF THE FACT AND TO IDENTIFY THE ASSAILANT.THE INCIDENT THAT THE COURT IS LOOKING AT IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE HUEY CASE.IN THE HUEY CASE, THE VICTIM RAN OUT OF THE HOUSE CALLING FOR HELP FROM THE POLICE. THE VICTIM GAVE -- THEN GAVE A STATEMENT TO THE POLICE ABOUT THE EVENT THAT TRANSPIRED.IN OUR CASE, THE VICTIM RUNS OUT AND SAYS, ""HE'S TRYING TO KILL ME."" SHE'S LITERALLY IN FLIGHT. SHE GAVE A STATEMENT TO THE POLICE AFTER THEY HAD WRAPPED A COAT AROUND HER.SHE TOLD THE POLICE THAT THE DEFENDANT HAD TOLD HER DURING THE BEATING THAT HE WOULD KILL HER, AND THE DEFENDANT CONTINUED THE STRESS OF THE INCIDENT THEN BY COMING OUTSIDE AND ACTUALLY YELLING AT HER WHILE THE POLICE WERE THERE.THE REPEATING OF THE STATEMENT OF THE DEFENDANT, ""I'LL KILL YOU,"" CONSTITUTES COMPOUND HEARSAY, AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT. HOWEVER, HIS STATEMENT IS AN ADMISSION OF WHAT HIS INTENT WAS UNDER EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 1220. HER EXCITED UTTERANCE COMES IN UNDER 1240.SHE ALSO BLURTED SOMETHING OUT THAT'S VERY INTERESTING. SHE BLURTED OUT, ""YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS NEVER DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS,"" AND THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING STATEMENT BECAUSE IT EXPLAINS I THINK WHAT'S VERY COMMON IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES; THE FRUSTRATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.AND HISTORICALLY, NOT A LOT HAS BEEN DONE FOR BATTERED WOMEN, EXPLAINS WHY SHE STAYED WITH HIM, WHICH IS THE QUESTION PROBABLY THE JURY IS GOING TO HAVE, THAT SHE DIDN'T FEEL PROTECTED; AND INDEED, SHE WASN'T PROTECTED.I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ALSO TO NOTE THAT DEFENDANT'S APOLOGY LETTERS WITH REGARD TO THIS INCIDENT ARE ALSO A HALLMARK OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THERE'S A CYCLE OF VIOLENCE THAT OCCURS. IT'S A THREE-PART CYCLE.BASICALLY YOU HAVE THE TENSION BUILDING PHASE. TENSION BUILDING PHASE INVOLVES EXACTLY WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE; TENSIONS ARE BUILDING UP.THEN YOU HAVE ACUTE BATTERING PHASE. WE ARE LOOKING -- IN THIS INCIDENT, WE'RE LOOKING AT AN ACUTE BATTERING INCIDENT. HE HITS HER. HE'S RAGING. HE'S OUT OF CONTROL.AND THEN THERE'S A THIRD PHASE, THE CONTRITION PHASE, THE LOVING RESPIT WHERE VERY CHARACTERISTICALLY, WHAT A DEFENDANT WILL SAY IS, HE'LL SAY, ""I AM SORRY,"" SENDS FLOWERS. AND WE KNOW THE DEFENDANT SENDS FLOWERS. I MEAN HE LEAVES FLOWERS ON THE HOME OF HIS EX-WIFE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHILE HE'S STALKING HER.THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HE DOES, AND IT'S PART OF THE CONTRITION PHASE.YOUR HONOR, I DO NOW HAVE IN COURT THE APOLOGY LETTERS THAT I REFERENCED EARLIER. AND AT THE COURT'S PLEASURE, MAY I SIMPLY APPROACH? AND WHAT I AM GOING TO DO -- I'M TRYING TO THINK HOW I CAN MARK THESE.

#MS. BODIN: ,"THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.I'M NOW GOING TO ARGUE TO THIS COURT THAT THE STATEMENT THAT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON MADE AND THEN HER SUBSEQUENT STATEMENT TO THE POLICE ARE ADMISSIBLE PURSUANT TO 1240.THERE WAS CLEARLY STARTLING OCCURRENCE. THERE'S LOTS OF EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT SHE WAS RUNNING, THE DEFENDANT BASICALLY IS COMING OUT RIGHT AFTER HER ROARING AT HER. BASICALLY THE POLICE ARE COMING TO AN INCIDENT THAT IS IN PROGRESS. IT IS A STARTLING OCCURRENCE.HER NERVOUS EXCITEMENT SURELY DOMINATED. SHE IS RUNNING OUT IN SWEATS AND A BRA TO A MALE POLICE OFFICER SCREAMING, ""HE'S GOING TO KILL ME.""I CAN'T IMAGINE A STRONGER CASE FOR NERVOUS EXCITEMENT DOMINATING AT THE TIME OF AN UTTERANCE.BUT THEN THE DEFENDANT COMES OUT AND HE EXTENDS THE TRAUMA TO HER BY YELLING AT HER SUCH THAT SHE HAS TO BE TAKEN INTO A POLICE CAR AND MAKES A STATEMENT TO THE POLICE.NOW, CLEARLY HER STATEMENT TO THE POLICE INCLUDED SOME QUESTIONING. THE QUESTIONING IS NOT A BAR TO THE ADMISSION OF 1240 STATEMENTS, AND FARMER DOES STAND FOR THAT PROPOSITION.AND IN FACT, IN FARMER, WHICH CONSTITUTES ADMISSIONS OF A 911 TAPE PURSUANT TO 1240, THERE'S LOTS OF QUESTIONING BY A DISPATCHER.IN FACT, IT'S ARGUABLE THAT THE STATEMENTS THAT WE HAVE IN THIS CASE ARE EVEN MORE SPONTANEOUS BECAUSE IN THE FARMER CASE, THE 911 OPERATOR ACTUALLY HAD CALLED THE HOME BACK AND SHE TALKED TO TWO SEPARATE PEOPLE. FIRST SHE TALKED TO THE VICTIM'S SISTER AND THEN SHE TALKED TO THE VICTIM IN FARMER.IN THIS CASE, WE HAVE A WOMAN BASICALLY RUNNING OUT IN THE MIDST OF A TRANSACTION AND MAKING A STATEMENT.WE'VE MET EVERY ELEMENT OF 1240. WE ARE GOING TO ASK THE COURT TO ADMIT HER STATEMENTS AS WELL AS THE CORROBORATING EVIDENCE, THE 911 TAPES, THE SCREAMING, THE PICTURES, THREE APOLOGY LETTERS, THE PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT, SUBSEQUENTLY A TRIAL MEDICAL RECORD, SWORN DEPOSITION, AND WE DO HAVE A TAPE, I SHOULD TELL THE COURT THAT, ALTHOUGH I'M NOT GOING TO PRESENT IT IN THIS HEARING, WHERE THE DEFENDANT TALKS ABOUT THIS ON ESPN, TALKS ABOUT THIS INCIDENT, HE MINIMIZES IT, HE SAYS IT WAS AN ACCIDENT, SAYS -- AT ONE POINT, HE TELLS OFFICER FARRELL ON A LATER OCCASION FROM THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING I THINK IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BECAUSE BATTERERS TYPICALLY MINIMIZE WHAT THEY DO. THEY REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF WHAT THEY DO. BUT THEY DO BEAT. AND THIS DEFENDANT HIT HER ON THIS OCCASION.I'M ASKING THE COURT TO ENTER THAT STATEMENT PURSUANT TO 1240, HER SUBSEQUENT STATEMENT TO THE POLICE.IN 1988 TO 1989, THERE WAS AN INCIDENT WITNESSED BY ALFRED ACOSTA, A LIMOUSINE DRIVER, WHEREIN HE SAW THE DEFENDANT BACKHAND NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON IN THE CAR.WHAT WAS NOT MENTIONED IN THE DEFENDANT'S PRESENTATION OF FACTS WAS THAT SHE WAS SO FRIGHTENED APPARENTLY THAT SHE INVITED A LIMOUSINE DRIVER INTO HER HOUSE, ARGUABLY TO PROTECT HERSELF. AND WHEN THEY GOT IN THE HOUSE, HE SAW THE DEFENDANT ACTUALLY LUNGE AT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A STRONG AND CONSISTENT THEME OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE ONCE AGAIN APPEARING IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DEFENDANT AND THE VICTIM.IN 1989, THERE WAS AN INCIDENT THAT WAS WITNESSED BY JULIENNE HENDRICKS AND DENISE BROWN THAT OCCURRED AT THE MALIBU RED ONION. MR. UELMEN EUPHEMISTICALLY CHARACTERIZED THIS AS A VERBAL ARGUMENT.THE TRUE FACTS OF THIS INCIDENT ARE THIS:THAT THE DEFENDANT AND THE VICTIM WERE PRESENT AT THE MALIBU RED ONION WITH JULIENNE HENDRICKS AND DENISE BROWN. IN PUBLIC, THE DEFENDANT GRABBED THE CROTCH OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON AND SAID, ""THIS IS MINE. THIS IS WHERE MY CHILDREN COME FROM.""THIS ISN'T A BUMPY MARRIAGE. THIS ISN'T A VERBAL ARGUMENT. THIS IS OUT AND OUT DENIGRATION AND PUBLIC HUMILIATION.BUT IT DIDN'T STOP THERE, BECAUSE WHEN IT GOT TO THE CAR, THE DEFENDANT ACTUALLY PUSHED HER OUT OF THE CAR.WE THEN HAVE AN INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED IN 1991 WHERE EDDIE REYNOZA HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THE DEFENDANT WHERE HE TOLD REYNOZA THAT IF HE CAUGHT ANY ONE OF HIS WIFE'S BOYFRIENDS DRIVING ANY OF HIS CARS, HE WOULD QUOTE, CUT HIS FUCKING HEAD OFF.AND THAT DISPLAYS THE DEFENDANT'S JEALOUSY, HIS NEED TO CONTROL NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON AND IT IS CHARACTERISTIC OF A BATTERING RELATIONSHIP AND IS PERMISSIBLE UNDER THE CASE LAW THAT I'VE ALREADY CITED TO THE COURT.IN 1992, NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON SEPARATED FROM THE DEFENDANT. JUDITHA BROWN, THE MOTHER OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, HEARD THE DEFENDANT SAY WHENEVER HE SAW NICOLE WITH ANOTHER MAN, THAT HE COMPLAINED THAT HE WAS PAYING FOR THAT MAN'S MEALS, YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE DEFENDANT'S JEALOUSY.I SHOULD ADD, YOU KNOW, THE DEFENSE HAS TAKEN EACH ONE OF THESE INCIDENTS AND PICKED IT APART AND THE DEFENSE HAS SAID, ""WELL, YOU KNOW, HOW IS THIS RELEVANT TO A MURDER THAT OCCURRED IN 1994?""THESE ACTS WHEN TAKEN AS A WHOLE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE DEFENDANT WAS POSSESSIVE, THAT HE WAS JEALOUS, THAT HE NEEDED TO DOMINATE, THAT HE NEEDED TO CONTROL NOT JUST BY USING PHYSICAL VIOLENCE. PHYSICAL VIOLENCE IS A VERY GOOD TOOL FOR CONTROLLING SOMEBODY, BUT IT'S NOT THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN CONTROL SOMEBODY.YOU CAN CONTROL SOMEBODY WITH JEALOUSY BY PUBLIC HUMILIATION AND ALL THE WAYS THAT I TALKED ABOUT, PROPERTY DAMAGE. AND THIS IS YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THAT TYPE OF CONTROL.AFTER THEY SEPARATED, THE DEFENDANT ALSO TOLD JUDITHA BROWN THAT HE SHOULD LET HER GO, ""BUT I CAN'T LET HER GO. I CAN'T LET HER GO,"" YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HIS JEALOUSY, HIS OBSESSIVENESS, HIS NEED TO POSSESS HER. THEY TRIED TO RECONCILE, BUT COULD NOT AND TRIED TO RECONCILE FOR A TWO-YEAR PERIOD.THE QUESTION I THINK, AND IT WILL ARISE CERTAINLY IN THE MINDS OF THE JURY, WELL, WHY WOULD A BATTERED WOMAN EVER RECONCILE WITH HER BATTERER? THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS WHY A BATTERED WOMAN WOULD RECONCILE WITH A BATTERER.NUMBER ONE, WE KNOW FROM THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE OR THE EMPIRICAL STUDIES THAT A BATTERED WOMAN IS IN MORE DANGER WHEN SHE SEPARATES THAN WHEN SHE STAYS. SHE HAS EVERY REASON TO BE AFRAID THAT WHEN SHE LEAVES HIM, SHE'S IN MORE DANGER. SHE IS TO PLACATE, TO MODERATE, TO COPE WITH THE SITUATION.EXPERT CAN SPEAK TO THIS. AND WHAT MAY BE TO THE DEFENSE SEEMINGLY UNIMPORTANT EVENTS DEPICT A CLASSIC PATTERN OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, A CLASSIC PATTERN THAT SPEAKS TO PERMISSIBLE 1101(B) PURPOSES.IN 1993, NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON AND SOME FRIENDS WENT TO THE CALIFORNIA SUSHI RESTAURANT. AND THERE IS -- THERE WAS AN ARGUMENT THAT ENSUED.AND THERE WAS A POLICE OFFICER, OFFICER ECKERT FROM THE HERMOSA BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT, WHO WROTE A MEMORANDUM WITH REGARD TO THIS INCIDENT WHEREIN HE SAW THE DEFENDANT YELLING IN PUBLIC AT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON WHILE SHE WAS SITTING ON A CURB.IT IS YET AGAIN AN EXAMPLE OF HUMILIATION.THERE HAD BEEN AN ARGUMENT AT THIS POINT OVER A MAN THAT NICOLE HAD GONE OUT WITH, AN EXAMPLE OF JEALOUSY. AND IN FACT, THE DEFENDANT WAS SO ANGRY THAT HE ACTUALLY FOLLOWED ANOTHER WOMAN INTO A BATHROOM AT THE RESTAURANT.IN 1993, IN OCTOBER, WE HAVE ANOTHER BREAKING AND ENTERING OR ANOTHER PROPERTY DAMAGE INCIDENT AT THE GRETNA GREEN RESIDENCE OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON. WE HAVE A SERIES OF 911 TAPES WHERE NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON CALLS AND REQUESTS THE POLICE TO HELP.ON THOSE 911 TAPES, THE VOICE OF THE DEFENDANT ON THE SECOND TAPE CAN BE HEARD SWEARING, FILTHY LANGUAGE, MAKING REFERENCES TO SEEING NICOLE WITH KEITH ZLOMSOWITCH, YELLING, SCREAMING. AND THE NET RESULT OF THAT IS THAT THERE WAS A BROKEN DOWN DOOR AT THE GRETNA GREEN RESIDENCE.THERE IS A BASIS FOR THE ADMISSION OF THE STATEMENTS MADE ON THE 911 TAPE. THERE ARE ACTUALLY TWO SEPARATE CALLS.BASIS FOR THE ADMISSION ARE AS FOLLOWS:NUMBER ONE, EXCITED UTTERANCES UNDER EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 1240.NUMBER TWO, CONTEMPORANEOUS UTTERANCES, BECAUSE WHAT IS DEPICTED ON THESE 911 TAPES IS A TRANSACTION IN PROGRESS. YOU CAN ACTUALLY HEAR THE DEFENDANT IN THE BACKGROUND AND YOU CAN HEAR NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON TALKING ABOUT THE DOOR BEING BROKEN IN. THERE ARE ADMISSIONS MADE BY THE DEFENDANT WITH REGARD TO THE INCIDENTS INVOLVING KEITH ZLOMSOWITCH.THE DEFENSE HAS MADE THE POINT THAT WE CANNOT ENTER HER STATEMENT, THAT THE DEFENDANT WAS GOING, AND I QUOTE, FUCKING NUTS AS INADMISSIBLE OPINION EVIDENCE. AND I'LL ADDRESS THAT IN A MINUTE. IT IS NOT INADMISSIBLE OPINION EVIDENCE.FURTHERMORE, THE 911 TAPES FALL WITHIN THE BUSINESS RECORD EXCEPTION UNDER 1271, BUT WE STILL MUST NEED A HEARSAY EXCEPTION, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT.AND FINALLY, THERE'S AN ARGUMENT MADE WITH REGARD TO RIGHTS TO CONFRONTATION IN THE ENTRANCE OF A HEARSAY STATEMENT INTO COURT. AND I AM GOING TO TALK ABOUT ALL OF THESE.AND I'LL START FIRST WITH THE CONTEMPORANEOUS UTTERANCE.A CONTEMPORANEOUS UTTERANCE IS OFFERED TO EXPLAIN THE CONDUCT OF A DECLARANT, AND IT'S MADE WHILE AN INCIDENT IS IN PROGRESS.THERE ARE STATEMENTS MADE ON THE TAPE WHILE THIS INCIDENT WAS IN PROGRESS. YOU CAN ACTUALLY HEAR THE VOICE OF THE DEFENDANT, AS I'VE SAID PREVIOUSLY.FURTHERMORE, SOME OF THESE STATEMENTS CONSTITUTE ADMISSIONS PURSUANT TO EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 1220.AN ADMISSION IS ANY STATEMENT OFFERED WHEN IT CAN INCRIMINATE, AND THESE ARE INCRIMINATING STATEMENTS SIMPLY BY THE RAGE AND THE OBSCENITY DISPLAYED AND THE FACT THAT HE'S BREAKING INTO HER HOUSE AND BREAKING DOWN THE DOOR IS INCRIMINATING. THE FACT THAT HE ADMITS TO WATCHING HER IN ACTIVE INTIMACY WITH KEITH ZLOMSOWITCH IS ALSO AN ADMISSION. FURTHERMORE, IT'S AN EXCITED UTTERANCE UNDER 1240.NOW, I'VE TALKED ABOUT EXCITED UTTERANCE IN MY PREVIOUS ARGUMENT.COUNSEL HAS TALKED ABOUT HOW THIS WAS A 14-MINUTE CONVERSATION. WELL, IT'S TWO PHONE CALLS AND THE DISPATCHER IS QUESTIONING HER WHILE THIS LITERALLY IS GOING ON.AND AGAIN, IT'S SIMILAR TO FARMER WHERE THERE IS QUESTIONING GOING ON, VERY EXTENDED QUESTIONING. THAT DOES NOT DEPRIVE THE UTTERANCES OF SPONTANEITY AS REQUIRED BY 1240.SHE'S NARRATING THE EVENT AND IT'S MADE UNDER THE STRESS OF EXCITEMENT. SHE WAS LITERALLY BEING ASSAULTED THE WHOLE TIME THAT THESE 911 TAPES WERE GOING ON.AND THEN THERE'S THE ISSUE OF INADMISSIBLE OPINION EVIDENCE.WELL, THERE'S A CASE RIGHT ON POINT, AND THAT'S THE CASE OF PEOPLE V. GARCIA.WHAT THAT CASE STATES IS THAT THIS TYPE OF STATEMENT CAN COME IN. AND WHAT -- IN THE GARCIA CASE, THE VICTIM STATED, ""HE'S GOING CRAZY. HE IS GOING TO KILL ME.""THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE STATEMENTS MADE IN THIS CASE.AND WHEN MR. UELMEN MADE HIS FACTUAL PRESENTATION, HE SAID THAT SHE NEVER FELT THREATENED, AND THAT SIMPLY IS NOT TRUE. SHE DID FEEL THREATENED.IN FACT, I QUOTE -- I BELIEVE SHE STATES THAT, ""HE'S GOING TO BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF ME."" THAT'S CORRECT. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SHE SAID.AND IN THE TRANSCRIPT -- YEAH. AT PAGE 3, LINE 21 -- I'M NOW SHOWING IT TO COUNSEL -- THE 911 OPERATOR ASSISTED HER SAYS, ""OKAY, STAY ON THE LINE."" SHE SAYS, ""I DON'T WANT TO STAY ON THE LINE. HE IS GOING TO BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF ME."" THEY'RE QUOTES.YOUR HONOR, I'M GOING TO MARK THIS AS P-7.

#MS. BODIN: ,"FINALLY, WITH REGARD TO THE CONFRONTATION ISSUE, A NUMBER OF CASES HAVE HELD IF THE HEARSAY EXCEPTION CAN BE MET, THE CONFRONTATION RIGHTS OF A DEFENDANT ARE NOT VIOLATED. AND THREE CASES STAND FOR THAT PROPOSITION, ALTHOUGH THAT'S THE CONSISTENT THEME THROUGHOUT ALL HEARSAY EXCEPTION CASES.BUT THE CASE OF FARMER THAT I'VE ALREADY CITED TO THE COURT AT PAGE 905 TO 906 AND IN THE HUEY CASE AT PAGE 1388 TO 1394 -- THERE'S A THIRD CASE I'LL GIVE TO THE COURT, PEOPLE V. TRIPLE BALANCE AT 5 CAL. APP. 4TH 1235, ALL STANDING FOR THE PROPOSITION THAT ADMISSION OF HEARSAY DOES NOT VIOLATE THE RIGHTS OF THE DEFENDANT WITH REGARD TO CONFRONTATION.IN 1993, WHILE NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON WAS LIVING AT GRETNA GREEN, SHE HAD NEIGHBORS, AND THE NEIGHBORS SAW THE DEFENDANT ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS OUTSIDE HER HOUSE. ON ONE OCCASION, THEY ACTUALLY CALLED THE POLICE. THEY BELIEVED THIS HAPPENED SOMETIME SHORTLY AFTER NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON HAD GONE TO CABO SAN LUCAS.THEY SAW MR. SIMPSON OUTSIDE HER HOME LURKING AROUND AND TRYING TO LOOK IN THE WINDOWS. THEY ACTUALLY CALLED 911, AND THEN THE POLICE CAME TO THIS INCIDENT. THEY ALSO SAW THE DEFENDANT LEAVE FLOWERS ON HER DOORSTEP.AND THOUGH MR. UELMEN PERHAPS HAS TRIED TO CHARACTERIZE THIS AS SOMEHOW NORMAL OR SOMETHING THAT GOES ON WHEN YOU HAVE CHILDREN, I FIND IT ODD SOMEONE WOULD LEAVE FLOWERS AND BE HANGING AROUND THE WINDOWS OF THE HOME OF SOMEBODY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT EVEN IF YOU HAD BEEN MARRIED TO THEM BEFORE.AND TO CHARACTERIZE THIS AS BEING IN ANY WAY NORMAL OR CHARACTERISTIC OF A SO-CALLED BUMPY MARRIAGE IS SIMPLY A MISCHARACTERIZATION. ON ONE OCCASION, THEY ACTUALLY SAW HIM BARGE IN ON HER.THEN THERE ARE INCIDENTS WITH REGARD TO KEITH ZLOMSOWITCH. THE DEFENDANT ACTUALLY ADMITTED THAT HE HAD SEEN NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON AND KEITH IN AN ACT OF INTIMACY, THAT HE HAD LOOKED IN THE WINDOW.AND I BELIEVE THAT MR. UELMEN TALKED ABOUT THIS AS BEING CIVILIZED BEHAVIOR AND THAT WHAT WAS AN OTHERWISE OUTRAGEOUS CIRCUMSTANCE WAS ESSENTIALLY WELL HANDLED BY THE DEFENDANT.BUT MY QUESTION TO THIS COURT AND TO MR. UELMEN IS, WHO CREATED THE OUTRAGE HERE? THE OUTRAGE IS THAT THE DEFENDANT WAS LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW WHERE HE HAD ABSOLUTELY NO BUSINESS BEING THERE, NONE WHATSOEVER.AND IT WASN'T THE FIRST TIME HE DID THAT. WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE TESTIMONY -- RATHER THE INTERVIEWS WITH THE COLBY'S.AND FURTHERMORE, WE KNOW FROM MR. ZLOMSOWITCH THAT HE SHOWED UP ONE NIGHT WHEN SHE WAS HAVING DINNER AT MEZALUNA. HE WENT INTO THE RESTAURANT, ACTUALLY SAT THERE AND STARED AT HER. THAT IS -- IN FRONT OF HER FRIENDS IS LITERALLY PUBLICLY HUMILIATING.HE ALSO ON ANOTHER OCCASION AT A RESTAURANT CALLED TRYST, T-R-Y-S-T, TOLD KEITH THAT NICOLE WAS STILL HIS WIFE, AND HE SAT THERE ONCE AGAIN IN THE RESTAURANT AND STARED AT THEM.HE STALKS, HE STARES, HE HUMILIATES IN PUBLIC. STALKING IS ONE OF THE HALLMARKS OF HUMILIATING BEHAVIOR. IT LITERALLY STEALS THE SECURITY AWAY FROM ITS VICTIM.AND IN FACT, WE KNOW THAT THE SECURITY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON WAS BEING STOLEN AWAY FROM HER LITTLE BY LITTLE BECAUSE AS WE GET LATER AND LATER IN HER RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DEFENDANT, SHE IS CONTINUALLY EXPRESSING MORE AND MORE FEAR. SHE'S TELLING EVERYBODY SHE'S AFRAID OF HIM.AND YET ANOTHER STALKING INCIDENT IN 1994 WHEN SHE WAS HAVING COFFEE WITH JEFFEREY KELLER AND RON GOLDMAN, THE DEFENDANT SUDDENLY APPEARED AND HE PARKED ACTUALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET AND LIKE MOTIONED TO HER, ""COME ON OVER HERE."" AND SHE DID. SHE WENT OVER THERE.THIS WAS WITNESSED BY JEFFEREY KELLER AND IT'S I THINK INTERESTING BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IT WOULD ALLOW THE DEFENDANT TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHO MR. GOLDMAN WAS. WE KNOW THAT HE HAD SEEN HIM PREVIOUSLY. ONCE AGAIN, AN INCIDENT OF STALKING AND HUMILIATION.

","JANUARY 11, 1995 ",9:05 A.M.
#MS. BODIN: ,"THANK YOU.THERE WERE A NUMBER OF STATEMENTS THAT THE VICTIM MADE WITH REGARD TO HER FEAR.IN FACT, SHE TOLD A NUMBER OF PEOPLE VERY CLOSE TO THE ACTUAL MURDERING INCIDENT ABOUT HER FEAR. SHE TOLD HER MOTHER THAT EVERYWHERE SHE WENT SHE SAW THE DEFENDANT. HE WAS AT THE PAYLESS SHOE STORE WHEN HE WENT THERE AND HE WAS FOLLOWING HER IN HER CAR.SHE TOLD BETSY ROCKETT, TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE ACTUAL KILLING OCCURRED, THAT HE WAS PEEPING -- THAT THE DEFENDANT WAS PEEPING IN ON HER AND HE WAS STARTING TO WEAR DISGUISES.HE TOLD KRIS JENNER THAT SHE BELIEVED THAT HE WOULD KILL HER.NOW, MR. UELMEN HAS TALKED ABOUT THE INABILITY OF THE PEOPLE TO USE STATEMENTS OF FEAR.AND IF WE STOPPED AT THE ARGUMENT THAT MR. UELMEN MADE, THAT WOULD BE A CORRECT ARGUMENT, BUT MR. UELMEN DIDN'T MAKE THE COMPLETE ARGUMENT.THE ARGUMENT -- THE GOOD ARGUMENT UNDER 1240, AND THAT IS THE ARGUMENT THAT STATEMENTS OF FEAR CAN COME IN WHEN YOU CAN SHOW CONDUCT IN CONFORMITY AND WE DO HAVE CONDUCT IN CONFORMITY PURSUANT TO 1240 TODAY.WE HAVE RECEIVED INFORMATION FROM SOJOURN SHELTER THAT ON THE DATE OF JUNE THE 7TH, 1994, NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON MADE A CONTACT WITH SOJOURN. SHE COMPLAINED THAT SHE WAS BEING STALKED. SHE WAS AFRAID, SHE FELT CONFUSED, SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, AND SHE NAMED THE DEFENDANT AS THE PERSON WHO WAS STALKING HER.SHE ACTED IN CONFORMITY WITH HER FEAR. PEOPLE WHO ARE AFRAID MADE CALLS FOR HER. THEY GO TO ORGANIZATIONS LIKE SOJOURN, SHELTERS FOR BATTERED WOMEN.AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT EXIST FOR BATTERED WOMEN ARE THERE TO HELP THEM AND WOMEN GO TO THEM AND NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON WENT TO THAT PLACE BECAUSE SHE WAS AFRAID AND SHE HAD A REASON TO BE AFRAID.AND I THINK THAT ACT IS VERY SIGNIFICANT. IT IS SIGNIFICANT WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT IN THE LIGHT OF OTHER FACTS THAT OCCURRED IN THAT TIME PERIOD.WE KNOW THAT VERY CLOSE IN TIME, RIGHT AROUND THE MIDDLE OF MAY, THAT THE DEFENDANT GAVE THE VICTIM A BRACELET, A VERY EXPENSIVE BRACELET FOR HER BIRTHDAY, AND THE DEFENDANT TALKS THAT ABOUT THAT IN A STATEMENT TO THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT, AND THE VICTIM GAVE IT BACK TO HIM AND TOLD HIM THAT SHE DIDN'T WANT TO SEE HIM AGAIN.YOU HAVE AN ACT OF ESTRANGEMENT HERE AND ACTS OF ESTRANGEMENT, OF DISTANCING, ARE VERY IMPORTANT, AND UNFORTUNATELY, VERY DANGEROUS FOR BATTERED WOMEN. THEY ARE DANGEROUS.WHAT HAPPENS IS IT ESCALATES THE VIOLENCE AND AN EXPERT CAN SPEAK TO THAT. THIS ACT OF ESTRANGEMENT, OF GIVING BACK THE BRACELET, THE FINISHING OF THE RELATIONSHIP, THE ENDING OF THE RELATIONSHIP THAT HAD GONE ON FOR 17 YEARS PROVIDES A MOTIVE IN THIS CASE WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, A MOTIVE TO KILL, THE FINAL ACT OF CONTROL.THERE IS ALSO EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE THAT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON KEPT AN ACCOUNTING, AN AUDIT TRAIL OF ACTS OF VIOLENCE.WE -- WE HAVE HAD THE ABILITY TO GO INTO THE SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON. WHAT WE FOUND WHEN WE WENT IN THERE WAS THE LETTERS OF APOLOGY, NEWSPAPER ARTICLES RELATIVE TO THE 1989 INCIDENT WHEREIN THE DEFENDANT SUFFERED A CRIMINAL CONVICTION, FINALLY, FOR A VIOLATION OF PENAL CODE SECTION 273.5.THERE WERE PICTURES, PICTURES THAT WE HAVE AUTHENTICATED.BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICTATTORNEYS.)
","JANUARY 11, 1995 ",9:05 A.M.
#MS. BODIN: ,"PICTURES THAT WE HAVE AUTHENTICATED THROUGH HER SISTER, NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON. THERE ARE THREE PICTURES. DENISE BROWN HAS AUTHENTICATED TWO OF THOSE PICTURES AS BEING PICTURES THAT SHE TOOK OF INCIDENTS WHERE THE DEFENDANT BEAT THE VICTIM. THOSE PICTURES DEPICT A FACIAL BEATING AND THEN A VERY LARGE BRUISE UNDERNEATH THE ARM OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON.SHE LITERALLY CREATED AN ACCOUNTING, AN AUDIT TRAIL OF ACTS OF VIOLENCE, BECAUSE SHE WANTED SOMEBODY TO REMEMBER WHAT WAS GOING ON IN HER LIFE, AND THAT IS THE ONLY WAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT COULD BE INTERPRETED.THERE WAS ALSO A WILL IN THAT SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX. THESE ACTS AND THESE EXPRESSIONS OF FEAR ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, BECAUSE SHE DID ACT IN CONFORMITY PURSUANT TO EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 1240.THEY SHOW THAT SHE WAS AFRAID, AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO A JURY WHO IS GOING TO -- GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SOME REASONABLE INFERENCES WITH REGARD TO HOW THIS KILLING OCCURRED.YOU HAVE TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN KILLED HERE.

#MS. BODIN: ,"ALL RIGHT.AND THE COURT, AT THE END OF YESTERDAY, AS I HAD PREVIOUSLY STATED A FEW MOMENTS AGO, HAD QUESTIONED THE PEOPLE WITH REGARD TO EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 1250 AND THE ENTRANCE OF HEARSAY STATEMENTS WITH REGARD TO FEAR.THE GENERAL RULE ON THIS IS THAT STATE OF MIND CAN COME IN WHEN THERE IS CONDUCT IN CONFORMITY AND THERE IS SOME SORT OF RELEVANCY TO THIS CASE.NOW, WE HAVE STATEMENTS MADE WITH REGARD TO FEAR, AND SPECIFICALLY THE STATEMENTS NOW THAT I'M HONING IN ON ARE THESE STATEMENTS AND THESE ARE VERY CLOSE IN TIME TO THE -- TO THE ACTUAL CRIME.THERE WAS A STATEMENT MADE TO BETSY ROCKETT WHEREIN THE VICTIM SAID ""I'M AFRAID. HE IS PEEPING THROUGH MY WINDOW AND WEARING DISGUISES,"" AND THEN THERE ARE STATEMENTS MADE, WHICH WE FOUND OUT ABOUT YESTERDAY, TO A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COUNSELOR AT SOJOURN STATING THE FEAR OF THE VICTIM AND THAT HE WAS STALKING HER AND THAT SHE WAS AFRAID AND CONFUSED.THOSE ARE VERY CLOSE IN TIME. THE STATEMENT TO SOJOURN WAS MADE WITHIN FIVE DAYS OF THE ACTUAL KILLING. THE STATEMENT MADE TO BETSY ROCKETT WAS MADE WITHIN TWO WEEKS -- TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE ACTUAL KILLING.I HAVE TWO ARGUMENTS TO MAKE TO THE COURT THIS MORNING WITH REGARD TO STATEMENTS OF FEAR.FIRST OF ALL, THOSE STATEMENTS OF FEAR ARE RELEVANT TO SHOW HOW THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED. THERE WAS A STATEMENT OF FEAR. AND THE VICTIM WOULD HAVE TO HAVE HAD CONFORMED HER CONDUCT AND THAT HAS TO BE RELEVANT TO AN ISSUE IN THE CASE.SHE STATED THAT SHE WAS AFRAID. AND LIKE THE FINCH CASE, IF SHE WAS AFRAID, SHE WOULD NOT HAVE GONE OUTSIDE ON THE NIGHT THAT THE MURDER WAS COMMITTED. SHE PARTICULARLY WOULD NOT HAVE GONE OUTSIDE, GIVEN THE DEFENDANT'S DEMONSTRATED POSSESSIVE RAGE WITH REGARD TO HER INVOLVEMENT WITH OTHER MEN.WE KNOW THAT MR. GOLDMAN WAS ON HIS WAY TO DELIVER GLASSES.THIS CRIME -- THIS CRIME AND THE WAY THAT IT WAS COMMITTED SHOWS THAT THE VICTIM WAS TAKEN BY SURPRISE, AND LIKE THE FINCH CASE THAT WE HAVE CITED IN OUR BRIEF, SHE -- WHAT WE ARE SAYING TO THE COURT IS THAT SHE WOULD HAVE -- NOT HAVE GONE THERE -- WOULD NOT HAVE GONE OUTSIDE IF SHE HAD KNOWN THAT THE DEFENDANT WAS OUT THERE, AND THAT IS ON ALL FOURS WITH THE FINCH CASE, WHERE IN THE FINCH CASE, WHAT THE -- WHAT THE VICTIM IN THAT CASE DID HAD EXPRESSED FEAR AND THEN WENT BACK TO HER RESIDENCE AND WAS ULTIMATELY KILLED IN HER RESIDENCE BY THE DEFENDANT. IT IS ON ALL FOURS WITH FINCH.

#MS. BODIN: ,"ALL RIGHT.IN ADDITION, WE KNOW THAT THIS CRIME WENT UNDETECTED FOR A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, THAT THERE WAS NO SCREAMING THAT WAS HEARD BY THE NEIGHBORS, AGAIN SPEAKING TO THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE. THE VICTIM EXPRESSED SO MUCH FEAR TO SO MANY PEOPLE AND SO CLOSE IN TIME TO THE MURDER THAT THESE EXPRESSIONS OF FEAR CAUSED HER TO ACT IN A CERTAIN WAY THAT IS RELEVANT TO THE WAY THAT THIS CRIME WAS COMMITTED.AND THIS IS INFORMATION THAT A JURY SHOULD HEAR TO PERMIT THEM TO MAKE REASONABLE INFERENCES ABOUT THE WAY THE CRIME OCCURRED.MY SECOND ARGUMENT WITH REGARD TO EXPRESSIONS OF FEAR RELATE TO ESTRANGEMENT ARGUMENT AND I THINK THE ISSUE OF ESTRANGEMENT IS CENTRAL TO THIS CASE BECAUSE AN EXPERT WILL TESTIFY THAT IN A CASE SUCH AS THIS, A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE, ESTRANGEMENT IS FREQUENTLY A TRIGGER FOR HOMICIDE.THE ARGUMENT IS THIS: SHE MADE AN EXPRESSION OF FEAR TO SOJOURN. HER FEAR DROVE HER TO CALL SOJOURN AND MAKE A CONTACT WITH THEM, SOJOURN BEING A BATTERED WOMAN'S SHELTER AND AN ORGANIZATION THAT EXISTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF HELPING WOMEN WHO ARE BATTERED.HER CONDUCT WAS IN CONFORMITY WITH HER FEAR. IT SPEAKS TO ESTRANGEMENT. A PERSON WOULD NOT CALL A SHELTER BECAUSE THEY WERE HAVING A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR HUSBAND OR THEIR EX-HUSBAND. THEY WOULD CALL BECAUSE THEY ARE SEEKING TO GET AWAY, BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID, AND SO WE SEE AN ESTRANGEMENT THEME BEGIN.NOW, THE QUESTION IS HOW IS THIS RELEVANT? SHE IS MANIFESTING ESTRANGEMENT. WE KNOW THAT IN ANOTHER WAY ALSO. WE KNOW THAT SHE GAVE THE DEFENDANT BACK A BRACELET THAT SHE HAD RECEIVED FOR HER BIRTHDAY. HE ADMITS THAT IN HIS STATEMENT TO THE POLICE.IT IS THE PEOPLE'S CONTENTION THAT AT THE POINT OF THIS ESTRANGEMENT THE DEFENDANT THEN WAS GIVEN A MOTIVE TO KILL, BECAUSE ESTRANGEMENT IS SHOWN OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LITERATURE TO BE THE TRIGGER, THE MOTIVE FOR A KILLING IN THIS TYPE OF HOMICIDE.AND IN FACT, WHAT AN EXPERT WILL TELL THIS COURT, AND THIS IS WHY AN EXPERT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR A JURY AND FOR THIS COURT, IS THAT A WOMAN IS SIX TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE KILLED WHEN SHE LEAVES, AND IN FACT IN HOMICIDES OF THIS TYPE, BY THE END OF TWO MONTHS, IF A WOMAN IS TO BE KILLED -- IF YOU LOOKED AT A HUNDRED WOMEN WHO WERE HOMICIDE VICTIMS IN THIS TYPE OF A MURDER, 47 PERCENT OF THEM, 47 OF THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED WITHIN THE FIRST TWO MONTHS.

THIS WAS CLEARLY COMMUNICATED TO THE DEFENDANT WITH THE RETURN OF THE BRACELET.HER CONDUCT WITH REGARD TO DISTANCING HIM, THE ESTRANGEMENT, MOTIVATED THIS MURDER.

WHATEVER WE WANT TO CALL IT, SHE WANTS TO DISTANCE HERSELF FROM HIM.

#MS. BODIN: ,"AND I THINK OUR BRIEF IS PRETTY CLEAR ON THAT. HOWEVER, THE COURT I THINK ASKED ME, WELL, WHAT IS THE BIG PICTURE HERE? THAT IS THE QUESTION THAT THE COURT IS ASKING ME, WHAT DOES ALL THIS EVIDENCE MEAN?THERE IS A BIG PICTURE AND THERE IS A LITTLE PICTURE. THE LITTLE PICTURE I THINK IS THAT THE ACTS THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, THE STATEMENTS MADE BY THE DEFENDANT, FALL INTO SIX BASIC CATEGORIES.AND THE FIRST CATEGORY IS OBSESSIVE AND JEALOUS BEHAVIOR. FOR EXAMPLE, THE INCIDENTS THAT WE HAVE CITED TO THE COURT WITH REGARD TO OBSESSIVE AND JEALOUS BEHAVIOR. HE SHOWS UP AT RESTAURANTS. SHE IS STILL MY WIFE. IF I CAN'T HAVE HER, NOBODY ELSE CAN HAVE HER.THE INCIDENTS THAT I HAVE CITED WITH THE COURT ARE REPLETE WITH OBSESSIVENESS TO THE POINT WHERE HE IS LOOKING IN HER WINDOW TO SEE WHAT SHE IS DOING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.THERE IS A CASE -- THERE ARE CASES WITH REGARD TO OBSESSIVENESS, OBSESSING, RATHER, JEALOUSY AND POSSESSIVENESS. ONE OF THEM I CITED TO THE COURT WHICH IS DE MOSS WHICH IS CONTAINED WITHIN OUR BRIEF, IF I CAN'T HAVE YOU, NOBODY ELSE WILL.THERE IS THE SHAVER CASE, WHICH IS CITED IN OUR BRIEF, WHERE THE DEFENDANT IN THAT CASE HAD ACCUSED THE VICTIM OF BEING WITH OTHER MEN.THERE IS THE CARTIER CASE, ONCE AGAIN A CASE ON JEALOUSY, AND THE DANIELS CASE WHICH IS ALSO A CASE INVOLVING JEALOUSY.AND WHAT THE COURTS HAVE CONSISTENTLY SAID IN THOSE FOUR CASES IS THAT POSSESSIVENESS AND JEALOUSY PROVIDE A MOTIVE FOR MURDER.SECONDLY, AND THE NEXT CATEGORY, ARE EMOTIONAL AND -- ARE EMOTIONAL ABUSE AND PUBLIC HUMILIATION, AND THERE IS A CASE ON THAT, THE CASE OF PEOPLE VERSUS DANIELS, WHICH I HAVE JUST CITED TO THE COURT, WHERE THERE IS A HISTORY OF ENMITY AND QUARRELS WHERE THERE IS BASICALLY PUBLIC ABUSE GOING ON AND THAT PROVIDES A MOTIVE ALSO FOR MURDER.PROPERTY DESTRUCTION. THERE IS LOTS OF PROPERTY DESTRUCTION INCIDENTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE FACTS THAT WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT TO THE COURT. WE HAVE A CAR THAT HAS BEEN DESTROYED, WE HAVE DOORS THAT ARE KICKED IN, WE HAVE PICTURES THAT ARE WRECKED.
","JANUARY 12, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
#THE COURT: ,"SLOW DOWN. SLOW DOWN.
","JANUARY 12, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
#MS. BODIN: ,"OKAY. AND THERE ARE TWO CASES CITED IN OUR BRIEF, HELFEND AND HAYLOCK, BOTH OF THOSE INVOLVING ARSON. ONE OF THEM, INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, INVOLVING THE ARSON OF A CAR, THAT WOULD BE THE HAYLOCK CASE, AND ONCE AGAIN THE COURT HAS SAID THAT THAT PROVIDES A MOTIVE AND A -- FOR A PERMISSIBLE 1101(B) PURPOSE.THERE ARE CASES ON STALKING, AND INTERESTINGLY, THERE IS A CASE ON STALKING AND STARING THAT TALKS ABOUT STALKING AND STARING AND FOLLOWING AS BEING ADMISSIBLE ON THE ISSUE OF PREMEDITATION, AND THAT IS THE NICHOLAUS CASE WHICH IS CITED IN OUR BRIEF.PHYSICAL VIOLENCE REALLY IS TAKEN UP IN THE ZACK CASE. IT IS ALSO TAKEN UP I BELIEVE IN THE DANIELS CASE. IN ZACK IT WAS ADMISSIBLE ON THE ISSUE OF IDENTITY. IN DANIELS IT WAS ADMISSIBLE ON THE ISSUE OF MOTIVE.I MIGHT ALSO ADD THAT THERE WAS AN ARGUMENT MADE BY MR. UELMEN YESTERDAY THAT NONE OF THE ACTS OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE ARE SIMILAR TO THE CRIME THAT WAS COMMITTED, AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT IF THEY HAD TO BE EXACTLY SIMILAR -- AND SIMILARITY, BY THE WAY, IS NOT THE TEST AND I WILL TALK ABOUT THAT IN A MOMENT -- WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN IS THAT THE DEFENDANT WOULD HAVE HAD TO KILL THE VICTIM TWICE. SINCE WE KNOW THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE, THAT CAN'T POSSIBLY BE THE STANDARD AND ZACK TALKS ABOUT THAT.FINALLY, WITH REGARD TO FINANCIAL MANIPULATION, AND THERE ARE INCIDENTS WITH REGARD TO FINANCIAL MANIPULATION AND THERE IS TWO OF THEM.THE FIRST ONE IS A PRENUPTIAL LETTER WHERE BASICALLY THE DEFENDANT SAYS, WELL, YOU KNOW, IF THIS EVER HAPPENS AGAIN THIS PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT IS VOID, USING IT AS A TOOL TO KEEP HER CLOSE TO HIM. OKAY, I'M NEVER GOING TO DO THIS AGAIN, IT IS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN. HERE, I'M GOING TO PUT IT IN WRITING, THIS IS A PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT. THAT IS FINANCIAL MANIPULATION.HE ALSO, TOWARD THE END OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP, CLOSE TO THE TIME WHEN HE KILLED THE VICTIM, HE SENT A LETTER TO HER WITH REGARD TO REPORTING HER TO THE IRS, AGAIN ATTEMPTING TO MANIPULATE HER, TO THREATEN HER THROUGH FINANCIAL MEANS, AND THERE IS A CASE ON THAT AND THAT IS THE CASE OF ARGENTOS. THAT, INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, INVOLVED GOLDMINERS, AND WHAT THE COURT SAID IS EVIDENCE OF FINANCIAL MANIPULATION IS ADMISSIBLE ON THE ISSUE OF MOTIVE.CLEARLY THESE CASES ARE NOT LIMITED MERELY TO PHYSICAL ASSAULT. WE ARE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT PHYSICAL ASSAULT HERE. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A LARGE PATTERN OF ABUSIVE ACTS, NOT JUST PHYSICALLY ABUSIVE ACTS. THERE ARE MANY WAYS THAT YOU CAN ABUSE SOMEBODY. YOU CAN ABUSE THEM BY TRYING TO MANIPULATE THEM FINANCIALLY, AS I HAVE JUST SAID, BY RUINING THEIR PROPERTY, IMPORTANT PROPERTY, PICTURES, THINGS THAT PEOPLE HOLD NEAR AND DEAR TO THEIR HEART.AND THAT BRINGS US TO THE BIG PICTURE AND THE BIG PICTURE IS EWOLDT. I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING YESTERDAY THAT THE DEFENSE CITED EWOLDT AND MADE IT LOOK LIKE THAT WAS A CASE THAT WAS GOOD FOR THE DEFENSE. IT IS NOT GOOD FOR THE DEFENSE. IT IS A WONDERFUL CASE FOR THE PEOPLE ON COMMON PLAN, SCHEME AND DESIGN.AND IN THAT COURT THE LET IN EVIDENCE OF COMMON SCHEME AND DESIGN AND WE HAVE CITED THAT IN OUR BRIEF. AND MR. GOLDBERG IS GOING TO TALK IN GREAT DEPTH ABOUT THE EWOLDT COURT; HOWEVER, I WILL SAY THIS TO THE COURT, THAT THE COMMON PLAN, THE MONDAY DESIGN OF ALL THESE ACTS IS TO CONTROL AND TO DOMINATE NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON.IF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE DOESN'T WORK, WELL, LET'S TRY A LITTLE FINANCIAL MANIPULATION. WELL, IF THAT DOESN'T WORK, HEY, LET'S USE A LITTLE PROPERTY DESTRUCTION. IF THAT DOESN'T WORK, WELL, MAYBE I WILL START FOLLOWING HER AROUND AND SHOWING UP EVERYWHERE SHE GOES, SHOW UP AT RESTAURANTS AND SHOWS UP AT HER HOUSE.AND HE HAS SEEN BY MANY PEOPLE DOING THIS; THE COLBYS, KEITH ZLOMSOWITCH, JEFFREY KELLER, PEOPLE WHO ARE SEEING HIM FOLLOWING HER WHEREVER SHE GOES, IN HER HOME, IN HER RESTAURANT, CALLING HER.THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT DOES SHOW A COMMON PLAN TO CONTROL HER, AND WHEN HE FINALLY COULDN'T CONTROL HER, WHEN SHE WAS FINALLY BREAKING AWAY FROM HIM, WHEN SHE HAD FINALLY ESTRANGED HERSELF FROM HIM AND TRIED TO DISTANCE HERSELF FROM HIM, IT IS THE PEOPLE'S CONTENTION THAT HE KILLED HER.AND ALL OF THESE ACTS PROVIDE POWERFUL MOTIVE AND SPEAK LOUDLY TO THE ISSUE OF IDENTITY AND THAT IS WHAT ZACK SAYS. ZACK SAYS, LOOK, LET'S JUST LOOK AT IT THIS WAY. IF THERE IS A PAST HISTORY OF QUARRELS AND ABUSE AND ENMITY, THAT COMES IN FOR THE ISSUE OF IDENTITY. THAT IS THE PLAIN MEANING OF ZACK.AND THE OTHER THING THAT ZACK SAYS, AND I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, ZACK SAYS THIS:""NO DEFENDANT IS ENTITLED TO MAKE A REPRESENTATION TO A JURY THAT THEIR PARTING WAS PEACEFUL AND FRIENDLY, WAS DEVOID OF CONFLICT WHEN IN FACT THERE WAS A LONG HISTORY,"" AS IN THIS CASE, ""OF ABUSE ON MANY LEVELS.""AND THAT IS THE TRUTH OF THIS CASE AND ALL OF THESE ACTS OF ABUSE STARTING IN 1977 PROVE A LONG AND VIOLENT HISTORY AND THAT IS THE RELEVANCE. IT SHOWS A PATTERN.

#THE COURT: ,"MISS BODIN, LET ME ASK YOU THIS THEN:THE ZACK CASE APPEARS TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR STRATEGY AND REASONING FOR THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THIS HISTORY, AND MY CONCERN IS THAT ZACK, ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT CLEAR FROM THE RECORD OF ZACK, THE ACTUAL WRITTEN OPINION IS NOT CLEAR, THE INFERENCE IS THAT THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU ARE SEEKING TO ADMIT THAT ZACK DID ALLOW WAS ALLOWED IN REBUTTAL AFTER THE DEFENDANT HAD TESTIFIED.THE REASON I FEEL RELATIVELY CONFIDENT IN THAT ANALYSIS OF THE ZACK CASE IS THAT ZACK IS CITED IN THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT CASES FOR THE PROPOSITION THAT THIS IS ADMISSIBLE IN REBUTTAL.YOU ARE ASKING ME TO ALLOW THIS EVIDENCE IN IN THE PEOPLE'S CASE IN CHIEF, WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT SITUATION THAN WHAT WE FACE HERE TODAY, AND I DON'T KNOW THAT ZACK IS NECESSARILY A GOOD FOUNDATION FOR THAT REASON.

#MR. GOLDBERG: ,"MR. UELMEN STARTED HIS ARGUMENT YESTERDAY BY TELLING US A STORY ABOUT HOW WHEN HE WAS A PROSECUTOR HE AFFIXED A LABEL TO HIS VARIOUS CASE FILES, THEN I THINK HE SAID ORGANIZED CRIME, AND WOULD DISPLAY IT IN SUCH A WAY SO THAT IT WAS VERY VISIBLE AS HE CARRIED THE CASE FILE AROUND.AND I TOOK THAT STORY AS PERHAPS YOUR HONOR DID, AS AN APOCRYPHAL KIND OF STORY THAT WAS DESIGNED TO INDICATE THE MISCHIEF THAT CAN BE CAUSED BY FIXING LABELS TO THINGS IMPROPERLY.THE STORY DID, HOWEVER, CAUSE ME TO LOOK AT MY CASE FILE, THE SAME ONE THAT I BROUGHT DOWN WITH ME TO COURT TO CONTAIN MY ARGUMENTS AND SOME OF THE SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS, AND I NOTICED THAT I ACTUALLY DIDN'T HAVE ANY LABEL ON IT AT ALL.THE PROSECUTION HAS NOT LABELED THIS CASE. THE PROSECUTION DID NOT TELL THE DEFENDANT IN THIS CASE TO ENGAGE IN A PATTERN OF ABUSE AGAINST NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON OVER A PERIOD OF 17 YEARS. THE PROSECUTION DID NOT TELL THE DEFENDANT TO COMMIT A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOMICIDE.HE DID THOSE THINGS BY HIMSELF. TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY LABEL ATTACHES TO THIS CASE, HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT LABEL. WE DID NOT CREATE THE EVIDENCE. WE SIMPLY TAKE THE CASE AS WE GET IT, AND IT HAPPENS TO BE THAT THAT IS THE KIND OF A CASE THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH HERE.NOW, IT WAS OUR POSITION IN OUR MOVING PAPERS, AND IT IS OUR POSITION TODAY, THAT THERE IS A PARTICULAR RULE OF ADMISSIBILITY THAT PERTAINS IN THOSE KIND OF CASES, THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENT MOTIVE ANALYSIS, IF YOU WILL, WITH RESPECT TO THE ADMISSIBILITY OF OTHER CRIMES EVIDENCE IN THIS TYPE OF A CASE, AND IT IS VERY WELL-DOCUMENTED IN CALIFORNIA CASE LAW.I AM GOING TO DISCUSS THAT WITH YOU TODAY AND I'M GOING TO DISCUSS PEOPLE VERSUS ZACK, AS I KNOW YOUR HONOR WANTS ME TO.IN THE SECOND PART OF MY ARGUMENT I WANT TO TURN TO A MORE TRADITIONAL 1101(B) ANALYSIS AND SHOW THAT THIS EVIDENCE IS ADMISSIBLE FOR THE PURPOSES OF SHOWING INTENT, IDENTITY, COMMON PLAN, SCHEME AND DESIGN UNDER A MORE TRADITIONAL TYPE OF APPROACH.I WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT A LITTLE LATER ON THE THIRD PART OF MY ARGUMENT ABOUT THE DUE PROCESS ARGUMENT THAT WAS MADE. ALTHOUGH COUNSEL DID NOT REPEAT IT YESTERDAY, I'M NOT SURE WHETHER HE IS WITHDRAWING THAT.AND FINALLY, I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 352 AND WHY IT IS THAT THE EVIDENCE IS NOT EXCLUDABLE UNDER THAT SECTION.NOW, FIRST IT IS OUR POSITION, AS WE SAID, THAT THERE IS A RULE BASED ON COMMON SENSE, BASED ON LAW, THAT IN RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASESTHE JURY MUST HEAR EVIDENCE REGARDING THE RELATIONSHIP. THAT IS ABOUT AS SUCCINCTLY AS I CAN PUT IT.AND THIS NOTION THAT WE HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED FOR OF SAYING THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENT MOTIVE ANALYSIS THAT YOU APPLY IN THIS KIND OF A CASE IS NOT IN IN WAY NOVEL, BECAUSE IN FACT THE COURT IN PEOPLE VERSUS SALAZAR, WHICH WE CITED IN OUR BRIEF, SAID THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF SEX OFFENSE CASES, QUOTE:""IN SEX OFFENSE CASES OUR SUPREME COURT HAS SET FORTH A LESS STRINGENT TEST FOR ADMISSION OF EVIDENCE OF UNCHARGED OFFENSES,"" END QUOTE, ""WHEN THE PRIOR OFFENSE INVOLVED THE SAME VICTIM AND THE SAME DEFENDANT.""SO IT IS A VERY ANALOGOUS SITUATION.AND THE POINT IS THAT WHEN WE EXAMINE CALIFORNIA CASE LAW, WE SEE THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT AREAS WHERE THERE ARE RELATIVELY WELL-DEFINED RULES ALMOST OF BLACK LETTER ADMISSIBILITY WITH RESPECT TO THE ADMISSIONS OF PRIOR CRIMES EVIDENCE.THE SEX OFFENSE CASES INVOLVING SITUATIONS WHERE THE PRIOR INSTANCES INVOLVE THE SAME DEFENDANT AND THE SAME VICTIM ARE ONE. WE ARE TELLING THE COURT THAT THE CALIFORNIA CASE LAW CLEARLY INDICATES THAT RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASES IS ANOTHER, AND IT IS NOT SIMPLY BASED ON PEOPLE VERSUS ZACK, BUT RATHER A NUMBER OF CASES, AND I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THOSE AS WELL.BUT BEFORE GETTING INTO THAT RATHER DENSE LEGAL ANALYSIS, AND I THINK IT IS NECESSARY, IN LIGHT OF COUNSEL'S ARGUMENT AND SOME OF THE COURT'S QUESTIONS, I JUST WANTED TO FIRST DISCUSS FROM A COMMON SENSE PERSPECTIVE WHY IT IS THAT THIS PARTICULAR RULE EXISTS AND GIVE SOME HYPOTHETICALS IN ORDER TO ILLUSTRATE IT.WHERE SOMEONE KILLS ANOTHER PERSON WITH WHOM THEY WERE INVOLVED IN A RELATIONSHIP, IT SEEMS THAT THE FIRST QUESTION THAT THE LOGICAL MIND IS GOING TO ASK IS WHAT WAS THE RELATIONSHIP, WHAT WAS THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP, WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE RELATIONSHIP?THOSE ARE PROBABLY THE FIRST QUESTIONS THAT ANY JURY WOULD ASK IN ANY KIND OF A RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASE, AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE AN ENTIRE BODY OF CASE LAW IN THIS STATE THAT GOVERNS ADMISSIBILITY ISSUES IN THAT CONTEXT.NOW, WHY FROM A COMMON SENSE PERSPECTIVE IS THAT THE RULE? WHY WOULD THERE BE A SPECIAL SET OF RULES OR AT LEAST A WHOLE BODY OF CASE LAW DEVOTED TO THIS AREA?WELL, LET'S SAY, YOUR HONOR, THAT IN THIS CASE OR IN ANY MURDER CASE INVOLVING A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MURDER OR A RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE MURDER, THE DEFENDANT WANTED TO PUT ON EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT HE GOT ALONG VERY WELL WITH THE VICTIM, THEY WERE VERY CLOSE, THEY HELD HANDS, THEY WERE AFFECTIONATE WITH ONE ANOTHER, HE CALLED FRIENDS AND PEOPLE TO CHARACTERIZE THE RELATIONSHIP IN THAT WAY.WOULDN'T THAT CLEARLY BE ADMISSIBLE WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY 1101 ANALYSIS? IT IS NOT CHARACTER EVIDENCE; IT IS JUST EVIDENCE CHARACTERIZING A RELATIONSHIP.AND IF YOUR HONOR CAN IMAGINE THE REVERSE OF THAT SCENARIO, THE PROSECUTION PUTTING ON EVIDENCE THAT TWO PEOPLE WERE ESTRANGED, DISTANT, THAT THEY QUARRELED, THAT THEY WERE SPLITTING APART, PERHAPS THAT THE HUSBAND HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH ANOTHER WOMAN, WOULDN'T THAT CLEARLY BE RELEVANT TO CHARACTERIZE THE RELATIONSHIP?AND AGAIN, IT IS NOT REALLY 1101(B) EVIDENCE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT; IT IS JUST EVIDENCE WHICH CHARACTERIZES AND EXPLAINS THE DYNAMIC OF THAT RELATIONSHIP.NOW, I WOULD LIKE THE COURT TO IMAGINE ANOTHER HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION AND THAT WOULD BE A CASE WHERE THE VICTIM HAS BATTERED THE DEFENDANT OR ABUSED THE DEFENDANT, BECAUSE COMMONLY WE THINK OF THAT NOW UNDER SOME MODERN APPROACHES THAT ARE USED IN OUR COURTS AS BEING DEFENSE EVIDENCE THAT WOULD NEGATE MURDER TO MANSLAUGHTER POTENTIALLY UNDER AN HONEST BUT UNREASONABLE BELIEF IN SELF-DEFENSE.BUT THOUGHT OF ANOTHER WAY IT COULD ALSO BE VERY POWERFUL PROSECUTION EVIDENCE. IT COULD BE EVIDENCE THAT CLEARLY INDICATES WHY THE DEFENDANT HAD A MOTIVE TO KILL HIS ABUSER OR HER ABUSER.AND IF THE EVIDENCE DID NOT INDICATE AN IMMINENT FEAR, IT WOULD BE VERY POWERFUL EVIDENCE OF A FIRST DEGREE MURDER. IS THAT 1101(B) EVIDENCE? OF COURSE NOT. IT IS NOT CHARACTER EVIDENCE. IT IS SIMPLY EVIDENCE WHICH CHARACTERIZES A RELATIONSHIP AND SHOWS THE DYNAMIC IN THAT RELATIONSHIP THAT ALLOWED A MURDER TO HAPPEN.NOW, THOUGHT OF THAT WAY, THE EVIDENCE THAT WE ARE PUTTING IN, RELATIONSHIP EVIDENCE ISN'T REALLY IN MANY SENSES 1101(B) EVIDENCE, IT IS NOT CHARACTER EVIDENCE, BY RATHER SIMPLY TRANSACTIONAL EVIDENCE TO SHOW WHAT THE DEVELOPMENT WAS OF THIS RELATIONSHIP, WHAT THE CHARACTERISTICS WERE IN THAT RELATIONSHIP IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN HOW THE HOMICIDE OCCURRED.NOW, THIS RULE THAT I HAVE JUST CITED OR THAT I HAVE JUST ARGUED FROM THE COMMON SENSE PERSPECTIVE WAS PUT FORWARD VERY SUCCINCTLY IN THE CASE OF PEOPLE VERSUS HELFEND WHICH WAS A CASE WHERE A DEFENDANT MURDERED HIS EX-WIFE'S HUSBAND.AND THERE WAS A HISTORY AND A PATTERN OF HARASSMENT IN THAT CASE. FOUR YEARS PRIOR TO THE HOMICIDE HE HAD BURNT DOWN THE VICTIM'S HOME. THIS IS ONE OF THE CASES THAT MISS BODIN CITED FOR THE PROPOSITION THAT PROPERTY DESTRUCTION IS RELEVANT IN A DOMESTIC -- IN A RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASE, AND HERE IS WHAT THE COURT SAID. QUOTE:""WHEN THE MOTIVE OF A CRIME IS SOUGHT TO BE ESTABLISHED BEFORE A JURY, THE WHOLE CONDUCT, LIFE AND CHARACTER OF THE PARTIES AS AFFECTING THIS QUESTION IS OPEN TO INQUIRY.""WELL, THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT I'M SAYING, YOUR HONOR, THAT WHERE THIS IS A RELATIONSHIP. WE HAVE TO OPEN THAT UP RELATIONSHIP, EXAMINE IT, FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON FOR THE PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHY THAT MURDER OCCURRED.SO EVEN IF PEOPLE VERSUS ZACK WASN'T IN EXISTENCE, OF COURSE I WOULD STILL BE ASKING FOR THE EVIDENCE TO BE ADMITTED UNDER PEOPLE VERSUS HELFEND AND MANY OF THE OTHER CASES THAT WAVE CITED IN OUR BRIEF.NOW, THE DEFENSE POSITION APPEARS TO BE THAT WE CANNOT OFFER EVIDENCE ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP, THAT WE ARE NOT ENTITLED TO CHARACTERIZE THE RELATIONSHIP.I WAS -- I DID NOT UNDERSTAND, UNTIL YESTERDAY, THE EXACT POSITION THAT THEY WERE TAKING ON THIS ISSUE. IN TRYING TO ANTICIPATE THE ARGUMENTS, I WASN'T SURE WHETHER COUNSEL WAS GOING TO SUGGEST THAT WE CAN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP AT ALL OR WHETHER THEY WERE GOING TO PROPOSE SOME KIND OF SANITIZED VERSION OF THE RELATIONSHIP.AND I WOULD LIKE TO EXPLAIN WHAT I MEAN ABOUT THAT. LET'S IMAGINE THAT WE TRIED THE CASE, YOUR HONOR, WITHOUT TELLING THE JURY THAT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON WAS EVER MARRIED TO THE DEFENDANT, WAS JUST A WOMAN WHO WAS MURDERED. RONALD GOLDMAN WAS JUST A MAN THAT WAS MURDERED, AND WE DID NOT TELL THEM OF THE EXISTENCE OF ANY RELATIONSHIP AT ALL.IT IS ALMOST UNIMAGINABLE, BECAUSE THE JURY WOULD HAVE TO CALL INTO QUESTION ALL OF OUR EVIDENCE, NO MATTER HOW STRONG IT WAS, POINTING TO THE DEFENDANT AS THE MURDERER, BECAUSE WHY ON EARTH WOULD ORENTHAL SIMPSON KILL AN ENTIRE STRANGER, JUST THIS WOMAN NAMED NICOLE OR THIS MAN THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE AND DIDN'T KNOW AND WHY WOULD HE HAVE KILLED THEM SO BRUTALLY? IT WOULDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AND IT WOULD UNDERMINE THE PROSECUTION'S CASE, CLEARLY.IT IS ONLY WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP AND YOU UNDERSTAND THE JEALOUSY, THE POSSESSIVENESS, THAT THE KILLING AND THE BRUTALITY OF THE KILLING OF NICOLE MAKES SENSE. IT IS ONLY WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND THE JEALOUSY AND THE POSSESSIVENESS THAT IT BECOMES UNDERSTANDABLE WHY ON EARTH HE WOULD KILL THIS YOUNG MAN WHO HE HAD PROBABLY ONLY SEEN ON ONE OCCASION BEFORE, THAT WOULD BE IN THE INCIDENT INVOLVING STARBUCK'S COFFEE.WHY WOULD HE KILL THEM? IT BECOMES UNDERSTANDABLE IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE JEALOUSY. THE DEFENDANT DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WE KNOW. HE DIDN'T KNOW THAT THERE HAD BEEN A CALL PLACED TO MEZZALUNA TO RETURN THE GLASSES. HE DIDN'T KNOW THAT MR. GOLDMAN WAS HOLDING THE GLASSES. HE DIDN'T KNOW THAT HE HAD HIS CAR KEYS IN HIS HAND, THAT HE WAS GOING TO DROP THEM OFF AND LEAVE.TO HIM THIS WAS A MAN WHO AT NIGHT, UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HE BELIEVED TO BE VERY SUSPICIOUS, A POTENTIAL SUITOR WAS MEETING SOMEONE THAT HE HAD A POSSESSORY INTEREST IN AND THAT EXPLAINS WHY HE KILLED HIM, THE BRUTALITY OF IT.IN YOU SIMPLY SANITIZE IT TO THE POINT OF SAYING THERE WAS NO RELATIONSHIP, THAT CLEARLY WOULD BE THE PERPETRATION OF A FRAUD ON THE JURY. IT CLEARLY WOULD BE HIGHLY, HIGHLY MISLEADING.BUT WHAT THE DEFENSE POSITION APPEARS TO BE, IF I'M UNDERSTANDING THEM, IS NOT THAT WE HAVE TO SAY THAT THERE WAS NO RELATIONSHIP AT ALL, BUT WE HAVE TO SANITIZE IT, GIVING THEM WHAT I THINK THE DEFENSE WOULD PROBABLY CHARACTERIZE AS NEUTRAL HISTORICAL FACTS. THEY GOT MARRIED ON A CERTAIN DATE, THEY SEPARATED ON A CERTAIN DATE, THEY DIVORCED ON A CERTAIN DATE, THEY TRIED TO RECONCILE AND THAT DIDN'T WORK. THEY BROKE UP.I THINK THAT THAT IS -- THAT THEY ARE SAYING THAT THAT IS ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE CAN EXPLAIN THIS RELATIONSHIP.BUT WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST TO YOUR HONOR IS THAT THE TERMS THAT THEY WOULD PROBABLY CONCEDE THAT WE COULD USE, THE EVIDENCE THAT THEY WOULD PROBABLY CONCEDE WE COULD USE, DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM, IT DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY LESS OF A MISLEADING SCENARIO, BECAUSE THE TERM ""HUSBAND AND WIFE,"" THOSE AREN'T NEUTRAL TERMS. THEY DO IMPLY SOMETHING. THEY IMPLY LOVE, THEY IMPLY FIDELITY, THEY IMPLY THAT THIS MAN AT LEAST AT ONE TIME TOOK AN OATH THAT HE WOULD HONOR, THAT HE WOULD PROTECT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, AND A JURY IS ENTITLED TO DRAW THAT INFERENCE AND WILL DRAW THAT INFERENCE FROM THAT KIND OF EVIDENCE.IN OTHER WORDS, WHAT THEY WILL DRAW IS INFERENCES ABOUT THIS RELATIONSHIP WHICH ARE THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE KNOW THE TRUTH TO BE.AND I BELIEVE, YOUR HONOR, THAT THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE COURT IN PEOPLE VERSUS ZACK WAS TALKING ABOUT WHEN THEY SAID THAT THE DEFENDANT IS NOT ENTITLED TO HAVE THE JURY DETERMINE HIS GUILT OR INNOCENCE ON A FALSE PRESENTATION THAT HIS AND THE VICTIM'S RELATIONSHIP AND THEIR PARTING WERE PEACEFUL AND FRIENDLY, BECAUSE THAT IS THE KIND OF INFERENCE, WHICH IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY EVIDENCE, YOU WOULD DRAW AND THAT I THINK IS WHAT ZACK IS SAYING IN THE QUOTE.BY THE WAY, THAT IS ALL I THINK THEY ARE SAYING IN THAT QUOTE AND I WILL DISCUSS THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE LATER ON.THAT IS WHY THE PROSECUTION SAYS, AND IT IS NOT OVERSTATING OUR POSITION, THAT NOT TO ALLOW THIS EVIDENCE IS NOT MERELY TO DEPRIVE THE JURY OF RELEVANT EVIDENCE, IT IS TO DO SOMETHING MUCH WORSE. IT IS TO GIVE THEM JUST ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO INFER THINGS THAT ARE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DEGREES DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED FROM THE TRUTH. THAT IS, IT IS TRULY AS WE SAID, TO PERPETRATE A FRAUD ON THE JURY, AND THE CALIFORNIA CASE LAW DOES NOT PERMIT THAT.NOW, WE SAY THAT THIS RULE THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS ESTABLISHED BY PEOPLE VERSUS ZACK. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO STATE, BECAUSE COUNSEL ARGUED THAT THIS WAS THE ONLY CASE WE WERE RELYINGON -- IT IS NOT THE ONLY CASE WE ARE RELYING ON.THE REASON THAT WE RELIED SO HEAVILY ON ZACK IS BASICALLY TWO-FOLD. NO. 1, IT IS MY FEELING, AS THE FEELING OF MANY PROSECUTORS OR ATTORNEYS IN GENERAL, THAT IF YOU HAVE ONE CASE THAT REALLY TELLS YOU THAT YOU ARE RIGHT ABOUT THE LAW AND CLEARLY TELLS YOU THAT, YOU CAN CITE THAT ONE CASE AND THAT IS PRETTY MUCH ALL YOU NEED TO DO. THE LESS IS MORE TYPE OF APPROACH TO ADVOCACY.AS YOUR HONOR KNOWS BY READING OUR BRIEF, THAT WAS NOT THE APPROACH THAT WE TOOK HERE AND WE DID NOT TAKE THAT APPROACH HERE BECAUSE OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY COUNSEL IN HIS BRIEF AND BECAUSE OF THE ARGUMENTS -- WHAT HE SAID IS HE SAID ZACK IS WRONG IN A FOOTNOTE TO HIS BRIEF, SO WHAT WE FELT THAT HE HAD TO DO IS WE NEEDED TO BACK UP ALL THE WAY TO 1909, WALK ALL THE WAY FORWARD TO ZACK AND WALK FROM ZACK FORWARD TO PEOPLE VERSUS NICHOLAUS, ALL OF THESE BEING RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASES, AND SHOW YOU EXACTLY WHERE THE RULES COME FROM AND EXACTLY WHY THIS RULE IS IN FACT CORRECT.ON PAGE 27 THROUGH 33 OF OUR BRIEF WE DISCUSSED TEN RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASES. NOT ONE, TEN. COUNSEL SAYS WE ONLY RELIED ON ONE. WE HAVE TEN IN THERE. MOST OF THOSE CASES ARE CASES WHERE A HUSBAND KILLED A WIFE OR A BOYFRIEND KILLED A GIRLFRIEND -- A BOYFRIEND KILLED A GIRLFRIEND. ONE OF THE CASES IS WHERE A GIRLFRIEND KILLED A BOYFRIEND.SO WE HAVE A LOT OF AUTHORITY ON THIS ISSUE AND A LOT OF THE LANGUAGE AND HOLDINGS OF THOSE CASES ARE EVERY BIT AS PERSUASIVE AS THE ZACK CASE ITSELF, AND IN FACT WERE RELIED ON BY THE COURT IN ZACK.NOW, WHEN WE SAY -- I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THOSE CASES A LITTLE BIT LATER, YOUR HONOR, AS WELL, BUT I WOULD INVITE THE COURT -- IT ISN'T THAT LENGTHY A PORTION OF OUR BRIEF -- TO LOOK AT 27 THROUGH 33 BECAUSE WE REALLY DID LAY OUT THE CASES. WE TALKED ABOUT THE FACTS AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE HOLDINGS. I THINK IN LIGHT OF THE COURT'S QUESTIONS AND COUNSEL'S COMMENTS IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO YOUR HONOR.NOW, WHEN WE SAY THAT THERE IS A DISTINCT MOTIVE ANALYSIS IN RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASES, I WOULD LIKE TO DEFINE WHAT WE MEAN AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF I CAN FRAME FOR YOUR HONOR THE CONTROVERSY THAT EXISTS BETWEEN THE PROSECUTION AND THE DEFENSE, IN OTHER WORDS, WHERE WE DISAGREE, VERY PRECISELY.WHAT I MEAN IS THAT WE MEAN THAT YOU DO NOT APPLY DISTINCTIVE MO ANALYSIS. THAT IS A KEY POINT OF WHAT WE ARE SAYING WHEN WE SAY THAT THERE IS A RELAXED OR MORE LIBERAL RULE OF ADMISSIBILITY IN RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASES.NOW, THE DEFENSE, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS CLEARLY CLAIMING THAT YOU STILL HAVE TO APPLY DISTINCTIVE MO ANALYSIS EVEN IN THE CONTEXT OF RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASES, THAT YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO APPLY IT, IF I'M UNDERSTANDING WHAT MR. UELMEN SAID.I BELIEVE THAT THAT SHARPLY DEFINES THE KEY LEGAL DISAGREEMENT THAT EXISTS BETWEEN THE DEFENSE AND THE PROSECUTION. THEY SAY YOU HAVE TO APPLY MO, DISTINCTIVE MO. WE SAY THAT YOU DON'T.NOW, I WOULD LIKE TO DRAW THE COURT'S ATTENTION TO WHAT PEOPLE VERSUS ZACK SAYS ON THIS QUESTION, BECAUSE WHAT THEY DO, AND AGAIN I KNOW YOUR HONOR HAS READ THIS CASE, BUT I JUST POINT OUT THAT WHAT ZACK DID IS HE ACTUALLY DISCUSSED THE CALIFORNIA CASE LAW LEADING UP TO ZACK AND THEY DID IT IN A FAIRLY SCHOLARLY AND VERY NICE FASHION IN TERMS OF LAYING OUT WHY THIS IS THE LAW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, AND AFTER DOING THAT THEY SAID:""AFTER REVIEWING THE LEADING CASES IN THIS AREA"" AND THAT INCLUDED CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT CASES WHICH ARE STILL VALID PRECEDENT ""FROM THESE PRECEDENTS, AS WELL AS COMMON SENSE, EXPERIENCE AND LOGIC, WE DISTILL THE FOLLOWING RULE: WHERE A DEFENDANT IS CHARGED WITH A VIOLENT CRIME AND HAS OR HAD A PREVIOUS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE VICTIM, PRIOR ASSAULTS UPON THE SAME VICTIM, WHEN OFFERED ON A DISPUTED ISSUE, E.G., INTENT, IDENTITY, MOTIVE, ET CETERA, ARE ADMISSIBLE BASED SOLELY UPON THE CONSIDERATION OF IDENTICAL PERPETRATOR AND VICTIM WITHOUT RESORT TO A DISTINCTIVE MODUS OPERANDI ANALYSIS OF OTHER FACTORS.""SO THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT WE ARE SAYING HERE AND THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE RELIED HEAVILY ON ZACK, SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY STATED IT SO CLEARLY AND SO NICELY, BUT THERE ARE OTHER CASES THAT STATE IT AS WELL, BUT WE SIMPLY LIKE THE LANGUAGE THAT THEY USED HERE.NOW, COUNSEL, IN THEIR MOVING PAPERS, TREATED THIS IN A FOOTNOTE AND WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT ZACK IS THEY INTERPRETED IT IN THEIR MOVING PAPERS THE SAME EXACT WAY WE DID. WE SAID, LOOK, WE KNOW THERE IS THIS CASE. WE KNOW THIS IS WHAT IT SAYS. WE KNOW IT SAYS YOU DON'T APPLY MO ANALYSIS. YOUR HONOR, IT IS WRONG. DON'T FOLLOW IT. IT IS BAD LAW.NOW, I HAVE TO COMPLIMENT THEM ON TAKING WHAT IS A VERY GUTSY APPROACH, BECAUSE THAT IS AN ARGUMENT THAT ATTORNEYS DON'T LIKE TO MAKE, THAT THERE IS A CASE THAT IS SQUARELY -- SQUARELY ADDRESSES AN ISSUE AND SAY, YOUR HONOR, PLEASE IGNORE IT, IT IS BAD LAW, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CAN'T COME UP WITH ANY REAL ARGUMENTS TO ADVANCE THAT POSITION AND THERE IS NO CONFLICT IN THE CASE AUTHORITY, THERE IS NO SPLIT IN THE AUTHORITY.SO WHAT THEY DID IS THEY APPEARED TO MODIFY THE APPROACH THAT THEY TOOK IN THEIR RESPONSIVE PLEADING AND THE APPROACH THAT THEY TOOK YESTERDAY, BECAUSE NOW THEY APPEAR TO BE TRYING TO DISTINGUISH ZACK AND THEY DID IT ON TWO GROUNDS:NO. 1, MR. UELMEN SAID, WELL, THE MURDER IN ZACK WAS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PRIOR INSTANCES THAT WERE ADMITTED IN THAT CASE BECAUSE THE VICTIM WAS BEATEN TO DEATH, AND WHAT THE ZACK COURT WAS REALLY SAYING IS BECAUSE OF THE SIMILARITY OF THESE INSTANCES THEY WERE ADMISSIBLE.NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH AND I WOULD LIKE AGAIN TO QUOTE FROM ZACK.I WOULD LIKE BRIEFLY JUST TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE FACTS OF THE CASE BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED IS HE ABSOLUTELY BRUTALLY KILLED THIS WOMAN IN ZACK AND IN MANY WAYS THE HOMICIDE OF THE WOMAN IN ZACK WAS FAR MORE GRUESOME AND HORRIFIC THAN WHAT HAPPENED TO NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON. I WOULDN'T SAY THE SAME THING WITH RESPECT TO THE MURDER OF RON GOLDMAN.AND THE PRIOR INSTANCES INVOLVED BLACK EYES, AND I KNOW THAT IF MR. UELMEN HAD BEEN REPRESENTING THE DEFENDANT IN THAT CASE HE WOULD SAY, MY HEAVENS, WHAT ON EARTH DO BLACK EYES HAVE TO DO WITH THIS KIND OF A BRUTAL HORRIFIC MURDER.AND HERE IS WHAT ZACK SAYS ON THAT:""COMMON SENSE, EXPERIENCE AND LOGIC COMPEL THE CONCLUSION THAT THE DISTINCT DIFFERENT MODUS OPERANDI SIGNATURE CALLING CARD ANALYSIS IN THE CASES RELIED UPON BY THE APPELLANT IS INAPPLICABLE IN THE PRESENT CONTEXT. HERE, GIVEN THE BRUTAL AND UNIQUE NATURE OF THE MURDER, APPELLANT'S PRIOR ASSAULTS UPON THE DECEDENT OF NECESSITY COULD NOT SURVIVE A DISTINCTIVE MODUS OPERANDI ANALYSIS. ONE COULD NOT KILL THE SAME PERSON TWICE, YET APPELLATE EXPRESSLY CONTENDS THAT HE HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY BROKEN THE DECEDENT'S TWO ANKLES NOR HAD HE PREVIOUSLY INFLICTED 21 WOUNDS TO HER BODY, NOR HAD HE PREVIOUSLY BLUDGEONED HER ABOUT THE HEAD,"" AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT OF THESE GROSS DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE PRIOR CRIMES AND THE CHARGED CRIME THAT THE ZACK COURT CLEARLY RECOGNIZED, THEN SAID, ""IT STILL COMES IN BECAUSE WE ARE NOT GOING TO APPLY DISTINCTIVE MO ANALYSIS.""NOW, COUNSEL ALSO USES A SECOND WAY OF DISTINGUISHING ZACK, AND I WANT TO DISCUSS THAT AS WELL. THAT IS THE CONCERN THAT YOUR HONOR ADDRESSED, DOES ZACK DEAL WITH IMPEACHMENT? AND I HAVE READ THIS CASE FOUR OR FIVE TIMES OVER THE PAST NUMBER OF FIVE OR SIX YEARS.

#MR. GOLDBERG: ,"GOOD. THEN I THINK YOU BEAT ME.AND I REREAD IT AGAIN OF COURSE WHEN COUNSEL SAID, WELL, THIS IS AN IMPEACHMENT CASE BECAUSE OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS THAT I HAVE BEEN FAMILIAR WITH THE CASE IT NEVER EVEN REMOTELY OCCURRED TO ME, AND IT SEEMS THAT THAT ENTIRE ARGUMENT IS PREMISED ON ONE SENTENCE IN SACK AND THAT ONE SENTENCE IS THE ONE THAT I ALREADY QUOTED TO THE COURT WHERE THEY SAY THAT, AND I'M PARAPHRASING, IN THE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE CHARACTERIZING A RELATIONSHIP, THE JURY IS GOING TO BE MISLED INTO BELIEVING THAT THE PARTING OF THE DEFENDANT AND THE VICTIM WERE ON AMICABLE BASIS, AND IT IS GOING TO BE MISLED INTO BELIEVING THAT THERE WERE NO PROBLEMS IN THE RELATIONSHIP.I DON'T SEE HOW THAT SINGLE INCIDENCE AND, THAT IS THE ONLY SENTENCE IN ZACK THAT EVEN ARGUABLY SUPPORTS THE DEFENSE POSITION, CAN BE READ AS CONSTITUTING AN IMPEACHMENT ISSUE. THEY DIDN'T MENTION, AS YOUR HONOR SAID, ANYWHERE THAT THE DEFENDANT TESTIFIED.WHAT THEY MENTIONED IS THAT THE DEFENDANT'S EXTRAJUDICIAL STATEMENTS WERE PUT IN EVIDENCE AND THE STATEMENT THAT HE GAVE WAS THAT HE WAS IN CARMEL FISHING AT THE TIME OF THE MURDER, AND THE PROSECUTION PUT IN EVIDENCE TO INDICATE THAT THERE WAS A VERY SERIOUS WINTER STORM AT THE TIME; THEREFORE IT WAS HIGHLY IMPLAUSIBLE.THE ONLY THING THAT HE SAID ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP IS HE DID IN FACT ADMIT THAT HE HAD PREVIOUSLY THREATENED HIS WIFE.THERE WAS NOTHING IN THAT EXTRAJUDICIAL STATEMENT WHICH WAS -- WHICH WAS WRITTEN ABOUT BY THE COURT IN A STEP-BY-STEP POINT-BY-POINT MANNER THAT SAID ANYTHING TO THE EFFECT THAT HE GOT ALONG WITH HIS WIFE. IN FACT, QUITE THE CONTRARY, BECAUSE AS I SAID, DID HE ADMIT THE THREATS.IF THIS HAD BEEN AN IMPEACHMENT CASE, YOUR HONOR, THEN WE WOULD HAVE SEEN CASE LAW RELATING TO IMPEACHMENT. WE WOULDN'T HAVE GONE THROUGH AN 1101 ANALYSIS, WE WOULDN'T HAVE GONE THROUGH A RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASE ANALYSIS. WE WOULD HAVE SEEN EVIDENCE CODE SECTIONS IN THE 700 SERIES CITED THAT DEAL WITH IMPEACHMENT.THIS IS STRICTLY, WHEN YOU READ IT, A 1101(B) RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASE THAT DISCUSSES -- DISCUSSES THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THIS EVIDENCE FOR THE PURPOSES OF ESTABLISHING AN ELEMENT OF THE PROSECUTION'S CASE, AND IN THIS CASE IT WAS IDENTITY.SO I DO SEE ZACK AS BEING ON ALL FOURS WITH THE CASE AND THAT VIEWPOINT IS STRENGTHENED BY THE FACT THAT THE CASES RELIED ON IN ZACK ALSO WERE 1101(B)/RELATIONSHIP SILENCE CASES THAT SAID THAT THIS WAS ADMISSIBLE IN THE PROSECUTION'S CASE IN CHIEF FOR PROVING IDENTITY, FOR PROVING INTENT OR PROVING ABSENCE OF ACCIDENT OR MISTAKE. THERE ARE A VARIETY OF THEORIES THAT THE CASE LAW HAS PREVIOUSLY ALLOWED THIS ON.NOW, I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOUR HONOR THAT THERE IS NO CALIFORNIA AUTHORITY THAT IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE RULE OF LAW THAT I HAVE ARTICULATED SO FAR THIS MORNING; THAT IS, THAT THERE IS A DISTINCT WAY, A DISTINCT BODY OF CASE LAW FOR ANALYZING THESE KIND OF CASES AND THAT WE DON'T APPLY DISTINCTIVE MO ANALYSIS.THE CASE THAT COUNSEL RELIED ON IN THEIR PAPERS VERY HEAVILY WAS PEOPLE VERSUS HASTON AND THAT IS THE SEMINAL CASE WHICH USES THE LANGUAGE OF PRIOR MO AND TALKS ABOUT SIGNATURE CRIMES AND THE LIKE.I WOULD LIKE TO ILLUSTRATE, HOWEVER, WHY EVEN IN THE CONTEXT OF A ROBBERY CASE, WHERE WE THINK THAT THE DISTINCTIVE MO ANALYSIS WOULD ALWAYS APPLY, IT DOESN'T EVEN ALWAYS NECESSARILY APPLY THERE, BECAUSE THE ISSUE IS ONE OF LOGICAL RELEVANCE.AND I WOULD ASK YOUR HONOR TO IMAGINE A SCENARIO WHERE I WAS TRYING, FOR EXAMPLE, A DEFENDANT FOR A ROBBERY OR A SERIES OF ROBBERIES INVOLVING DEPARTMENT STORES AND IT TURNED OUT THAT IN THIS SERIES OF ROBBERIES THE DEFENDANT HAD COMMITTED THE ROBBERIES WITH A CO-CONSPIRATOR, WITH AN UNCHARGED CO-CONSPIRATOR IN ALL THREE EVENTS.AND I SAID, YOUR HONOR, I WANT TO PUT ON EVIDENCE OF THREE OTHER ROBBERIES THAT HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO, THEY WERE OF RESTAURANTS, AND I WANT TO INTRODUCE THEM FOR THE PURPOSES OF SHOWING IDENTITY.AND YOU SAID TO ME, OKAY, WELL, MR. GOLDBERG, WHAT IS THE DISTINCTIVE MO? WHAT IS THE DISTINCTIVE SIGNATURE OF THE PRIOR ROBBERIES? THERE ARE DISTINCTIONS. I MEAN, THE CHARGED CRIMES INVOLVED DEPARTMENT STORES; THE UNCHARGED CRIMES INVOLVED RESTAURANTS. THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF OTHER DISTINCTIONS.AND I SAID, YOUR HONOR, THERE AREN'T ANY. THERE AREN'T ANY DISTINCTIONS THAT ARE PARTICULARLY UNIQUE, EXCEPT ONE, AND THAT IS THAT IN ALL OF THE PRIOR ROBBERIES THE DEFENDANT COMMITTED THEM WITH THE SAME CO-CONSPIRATOR, UNCHARGED CO-CONSPIRATOR, AS IN THIS CASE, AND ALL I WANT TO DO IS I WANT TO SHOW THAT THESE TWO PEOPLE ARE RELATED TO ONE ANOTHER, BECAUSE IF MY WITNESSES COME INTO COURT AND THEY IDENTIFY THE DEFENDANT CORRECTLY AND THEN IDENTIFY THE UNCHARGED CO-CONSPIRATOR CORRECTLY, THAT LENDS PERSUASIVE SUPPORT TO THE IDEA THAT THE DEFENDANT AND NOT SOME OTHER PERSON WAS THE ASSAILANT IN THE CHARGED CRIME, BECAUSE I HAVE SHOWN THIS RELATIONSHIP, SO THAT IS ALL I WANT TO SHOWN IS THE RELATIONSHIP.WELL, I THINK THAT YOUR HONOR WOULD ALLOW THE EVIDENCE IN, AND I BELIEVE THAT THE REASON THAT THE COURT WOULD ALLOW THE EVIDENCE IN, ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT IT MAKES LOGICAL SENSE, IS THAT THE FACTS THAT I JUST RELATED TO YOUR HONOR ARE PRECISELY WHAT HAPPENED IN PEOPLE VERSUS HASTON, THE VERY CASE THAT THE DEFENDANT RELIED ON WHERE THE COURT SAID THAT SHOWING THAT RELATIONSHIP, EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS NOTHING PARTICULARLY DISTINCTIVE ABOUT THE CHARGE AND UNCHARGED CRIMES IN AND OF ITSELF, WAS RELEVANT FOR THE PURPOSES OF SHOWING IDENTITY.NOW, THIS IS INTERESTING BECAUSE HASTON WAS EXTENDED IN PEOPLE VERSUS BEAMON. IT IS NOT THE BEAMON CASE THAT YOUR HONOR MIGHT BE THINKING OF DEALING WITH THE STANDARD FOR ACCOMPLICES. IT IS AN EARLIER CASE THAT WE CITED IN OUR POINTS AND AUTHORITIES, AND HERE IS WHAT THEY SAY THERE:""THE COMMON MARK OF IDENTICAL PERPETRATOR AND IDENTICAL VICTIM IN BOTH THE CHARGED AND UNCHARGED OFFENSES IS SO DISTINCTIVE THAT IT ADDS PERSUASIVE SUPPORT TO THE INFERENCE THAT THE DEFENDANT AND NOT SOME OTHER PERSON WAS THE PERPETRATOR.""THAT WAS AT PAGE 633.NOW, WHAT THEY ARE SAYING, THEREFORE, IS THAT NOW NOT ONLY CAN I GET IN A PRIOR CRIME IF THEY INVOLVE THE TWO IDENTICAL ASSAILANTS, BUT I CAN GET IN ANY PRIOR CRIME THAT INVOLVES IDENTICAL VICTIM AND IDENTICAL PERPETRATOR BASED SOLELY UPON THAT SINGLE SIMILARITY, WITHOUT REGARD TO ANALYZING ANY OTHER ACTS OF SIMILARITY.WHAT THE POINT IS THAT I'M MAKING, YOUR HONOR, IS THAT THE CASE OF HASTON ITSELF, PARTICULARLY EXTENDED BY BEAMON, BELIE THE VERY RULE THAT THE DEFENSE IS ASKING YOUR HONOR TO APPLY IN THIS CASE, THAT IS, THE DISTINCTIVE MODUS OPERANDI RULE ALWAYS APPLIES, BECAUSE HERE ARE TWO CASES THAT IT DIDN'T APPLY, EVEN THOUGH THEY DEALT WITH RELATIVELY TRADITIONALLY 1101(B) SCENARIOS WHERE TYPICALLY YOU WOULD APPLY THE RULE.THEY ARE TYPICALLY SIGNATURE FOR ANOTHER REASON AND THAT IS THAT THEY WERE RELIED ON BY THE COURT IN ZACK, AND THE WAY THAT ZACK ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT IDENTICAL PERPETRATOR AND IDENTICAL VICTIM IN AND OF ITSELF WAS SUFFICIENT TO GET THE PRIOR CRIMES IN, WAS BECAUSE THEY SAID THAT THIS WAS THE LOGICAL INFERENCE TO BE DRAWN FROM THE HASTON CASE, WHICH COUNSEL RELIED ON, AND FROM THE BEAMON CASE, WHICH THE PEOPLE RELIED ON.YOUR HONOR, I WOULD LIKE TO NOW TURN TO THE SECOND PART OF OUR ANALYSIS WHERE I WILL BE DISCUSSING A COMMON TRADITIONAL 1101(B) TYPE APPROACH.

#MR. GOLDBERG: ,"YES, THANK YOU.YOUR HONOR, JUST BEFORE WE BROKE, I WAS ABOUT TO LAUNCH INTO THE SECOND PART OF MY ARGUMENT, WHICH IS THE TRADITIONAL EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 1101(B) ANALYSIS.AND AS WE STATED, WE HAVE THREE SUB PARTS TO THAT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MODE OF EVIDENCE FOR THE PURPOSES OF PROVING IDENTITY, THAT'S ONE; MOTIVE EVIDENCE FOR THE PURPOSES OF PROVING INTENT, THAT'S NUMBER TWO; AND THEN ALSO, COMMON PLAN, SCHEME AND DESIGN, WHICH IS NUMBER 3.I WOULD LIKE TO JUST START BY MENTIONING SOMETHING THAT WAS STATED IN THE DEFENSE RESPONSE BRIEF, AND THAT WAS A DISAGREEMENT THAT THEY HAD WITH OUR POSITION REGARDING THE STANDARD OF REVIEW THAT IS INVOLVED BY A TRIAL JUDGE IN LOOKING AT THIS KIND OF EVIDENCE, BECAUSE WE TOOK THE POSITION THAT THIS WAS A QUESTION OF DISCRETION THAT INVOLVES AN ISSUE OF EVALUATING THE EVIDENCE TO DETERMINE ITS RELEVANCY.AND I JUST WANTED TO GIVE ANOTHER CITE ON THAT BECAUSE I DID REALIZE THAT THERE WAS AN AMBIGUITY IN THE CITE WE HAD GIVEN PREVIOUSLY.AND THAT IS PEOPLE VERSUS HASTON AT 69 CAL. 2D 246, THE SAME CASE THAT I PREVIOUSLY HAD CITED TO THE COURT AND THAT COUNSEL RELIED ON VERY HEAVILY IN HIS POINTS AND AUTHORITIES, WHERE THEY SAID:""IT IS CLEAR OF COURSE THAT THE ADMISSION OF OTHER CRIMES EVIDENCE TO PROVE IDENTITY IS ESSENTIALLY A MATTER WITHIN THE SOUND DISCRETION OF THE TRIAL COURT.""SO THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT INVOLVES AN EXERCISE OF DISCRETION. THAT IS THE STANDARD OF REVIEW THAT YOUR HONOR IS BEING ASKED TO USE HERE.NOW, I WOULD LIKE TO JUST START WITH THE LANGUAGE OF EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 1101 ITSELF BECAUSE SO FRANKLY WE DON'T GO BACK TO THE CODE SINCE WE'VE READ IT SO MANY TIMES.BUT IN 1101(B), IT SAYS THAT:""NOTHING IN THE SECTION PROHIBITS THE ADMISSION OF EVIDENCE THAT A PERSON COMMITTED A CRIME, CIVIL WRONG OR OTHER ACT WHEN RELEVANT TO PROVE SOME FACT SUCH AS MOTIVE, OPPORTUNITY, INTENT PREPARATION, PLAN,"" AND SO ON.I WON'T QUOTE THE REST OF THE LANGUAGE.AND THEN IT GOES ON TO SAY:""EXCEPT DISPOSITION TO COMMIT SUCH AN ACT.""NOW, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT LANGUAGE -- AND MR. UELMEN SAYS, WELL, THIS IS A RULE OF EXCLUSION OTHER COMMENTATORS ARGUE NO, IT'S A RULE OF INCLUSION.I THINK THAT'S JUST A SEMANTICS DEBATE.WHAT IS APPARENT FROM THE LANGUAGE, YOUR HONOR, IS THAT THIS IS A RELEVANCY TEST. AND THAT IS PRECISELY WHY THE STANDARD OF REVIEW IS ONE OF DISCRETION, BECAUSE WHAT IS BEING ASKED OF THE COURT IS -- IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE STATUTE, IS IT RELEVANT TO ANY OF THE ENUMERATED PROVISIONS, ANY OF THE ENUMERATED IDEAS OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT IS AT ISSUE IN THE TRIAL, EXCEPT DISPOSITION.SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THE PROSECUTOR SIMPLY HAS TO SAY, ""WE ARE INTRODUCING THIS FOR THE PURPOSES OF PROVING INTENT, IDENTITY, COMMON PLAN, SCHEME AND DESIGN OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT WE CAN LEGITIMATELY PROVE, AND THAT AS LONG AS THAT'S REASONABLE, IN OTHER WORDS, AS LONG AS OUR ARGUMENT IS REASONABLE AND ONE THAT A REASONABLE JURY COULD ACCEPT, THAT UNDER 1101(B), THE EVIDENCE IS ADMISSIBLE.""THAT IS WHY I CHARACTERIZE 1101(B) AS BEING A MERE RELEVANCY TEST.NOW, AS SUPPORT FOR THAT PROVISION, OTHER THAN THE STATUTORY LANGUAGE, I ALSO WOULD CITE THE CASE THAT WAS EXTENSIVELY RELIED ON, ONE OF THE TWO CASES EXTENSIVELY RELIED ON BY THE DEFENSE YESTERDAY. THAT WAS PEOPLE VERSUS THOMAS, 20 CAL. 3D. 457 AT 465.THAT WAS A CHILD MOLESTATION CASE WHERE THE DEFENDANT MOLESTED A DAUGHTER, AND 10 YEARS EARLIER, HE HAD MOLESTED ANOTHER DAUGHTER.AND THE WAY THAT THE CASE WAS BEING CITED, YOU WOULD THINK THAT THIS WAS A VERY DAMAGING CASE TO THE PROSECUTION ON THE ISSUE OF THE ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE. BUT IN REALITY, WHAT THEY DID IS THAT THEY SET FORWARD A STANDARD EXPLAINING 1101(B) ANALYSIS THAT REALLY CLARIFIES THAT IT IS AN ISSUE OF RELEVANCY, A RELEVANCY TEST.AND WHAT THEY SAID IS THAT THE STANDARD IS, QUOTE:""WHETHER THERE IS SOME CLEAR CONNECTION BETWEEN THE PRIOR OFFENSE AND THE ONE CHARGED SO THAT IT MAY BE LOGICALLY INFERRED THAT IF THE DEFENDANT IS GUILTY OF ONE, HE MUST BE GUILTY OF THE OTHER OR,AS THE MATTER IS SOMETIMES STATED, THE OTHER OFFENSES ARE SUFFICIENTLY SIMILAR AND POSSESS A SUFFICIENTLY HIGH DEGREE OF COMMON FEATURES OF THE ACT CHARGED, THAT THEY WARRANT THE INFERENCE THAT IF THE DEFENDANT COMMITTED THE OTHER ACTS, HE COMMITTED THE ACT CHARGED,"" END QUOTE.NOW, IT'S A LITTLE BIT CONVOLUTED PERHAPS, BUT ALL THEY ARE SAYING HERE IS, THEY ARE SAYING THAT IF THE PRIOR CRIME WARRANTS THE INFERENCE THAT IF THE DEFENDANT COMMITTED THE PRIOR ONE, HE ALSO COMMITTED THE CHARGED CRIME, THAT IT MEETS THE TEST OF 1101.THAT SOUNDS LIKE MERE RELEVANCY. THAT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS, WE HAVE TO ESTABLISH IT'S RELEVANT TO PROVE THE DEFENDANT IS GUILTY IN THIS CASE BECAUSE WE CAN USE IT TO PROVE CERTAIN OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE CRIME IN THIS CASE.

#THE COURT: ,"ARE YOU SUGGESTING I IGNORE THE SIMILARITY LANGUAGE IN THAT PASSAGE?
","JANUARY 12, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
#MR. GOLDBERG: ,"THE ISSUE OF SIMILARITY IS ONE THAT GOES TO RELEVANCE, LOGICAL RELEVANCE. AND NORMALLY SPEAKING, THERE IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE SOME SIMILARITY FOR THEM TO BE LOGICALLY RELEVANT.IN THE CASE OF PEOPLE VERSUS HASTON, THE ONLY SIMILARITY WAS IDENTICAL PERPETRATORS IN THE CHARGED AND UNCHARGED OFFENSE.AND PEOPLE VERSUS BEAMON, IT WAS IDENTICAL DEFENDANT AND IDENTICAL VICTIM.ZACK SAYS THE SIMILARITY OF IDENTICAL VICTIM AND IDENTICAL DEFENDANT IN AND OF ITSELF IS SUFFICIENT. SO WE ALWAYS HAVE TO APPROACH IT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF LOGICAL RELEVANCE AND ASK OURSELVES, WHAT IS IT THAT THE PROSECUTION IS TRYING TO PROVE HERE AND DOES THIS LOGICALLY PROVE THAT.AND NORMALLY SPEAKING, IF YOU APPLY THAT ANALYSIS, IN OTHER WORDS, A COMMON SENSE LOGICAL RELEVANCE ANALYSIS, THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE AT LEAST SOME SIMILARITY.I THINK IF WE WANTED TO SHOW THAT THE DEFENDANT HAD PREVIOUSLY COMMITTED THE OFFENSE OF DRUNK DRIVING, HOW ON EARTH WOULD THAT MAKE IT LIKELY THAT HE COMMITTED THIS MURDER? IT HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH IT WHATSOEVER FROM A LOGICAL, RELEVANCE STANDPOINT.BUT CLEARLY A SERIES OF OFFENSES COMMITTED AGAINST THE SAME VICTIM DO IN THIS CASE JUST AS THEY DO IN ZACK AND ZACK'S PROGENY.WHAT HAPPENED IN THOMAS BY THE WAY WAS THAT THE COURT DECIDED THAT ALTHOUGH THE PRIOR CRIME WAS TECHNICALLY RELEVANT UNDER 1101(B), BUT BECAUSE THERE WAS A 10-YEAR GAP, THE 10-YEAR GAP MADE IT SUCH THAT IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ADMITTED UNDER 352 OF THE EVIDENCE CODE.AND I WOULD ASK THE COURT TO JUST KEEP IN MIND FOR A PERIOD OF TIME THE FACTS OF THOMAS BECAUSE IT BECOMES RELEVANT WHEN WE DISCUSS PEOPLE VERSUS EWOLDT, WHICH DEALS WITH THE VERY, VERY SIMILAR FACT PATTERN AND WHICH IT WAS ANOTHER CASE THAT THE DEFENSE RELIES HEAVILY ON.AS WE SAID, PEOPLE VERSUS ZACK IS NOT THE ONLY RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASE WHICH SUPPORTS THE PROSECUTION'S POSITION.I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH THE PROSECUTION'S BRIEF AND GO THROUGH EACH OF THE OTHER CASES THAT WE FEEL ARE RELEVANT. I WOULD LIKE TO GO THROUGH SOME OF THE CASES WHERE IDENTITY WAS THE ISSUE IN RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASES AND DISCUSS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THOSE CASES AND WHY IT IS THAT THEY VERY CLEARLY SUPPORT THE ANALYSIS THE PROSECUTION IS PROFFERING HERE, WHICH IS THAT MOTIVE EVIDENCE IS RELEVANT TO PROVE IDENTITY AND RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS ARE RELEVANT TO PROVE MOTIVE.THE EARLIEST CASE IS PEOPLE VERSUS ARGENTOS. IT'S A 1909 CASE.THIS DEMONSTRATES, AS MR. GORDON POINTED OUT, THAT WE HAVE ALMOST A HUNDRED YEAR HISTORY, MAYBE EVEN EARLIER BECAUSE I COULD HAVE -- WE COULD HAVE TRIED TO TRACE IT BACK EARLIER. WE DIDN'T. WE FELT THAT THAT WAS FAR ENOUGH.THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY BEFORE THE ENACTMENT OF THE EVIDENCE CODE. BUT THEY ARE APPLYING THE COMMON LAW PROVISIONS AS MR. UELMEN POINTED OUT. THE 1101(B) TYPE ANALYSIS WAS PART OF THE COMMON LAW AND HAS BEEN FOR MANY HUNDREDS OF YEARS.PEOPLE VERSUS ARGENTOS DEALT WITH THE SITUATION WHERE THERE WERE TWO GOLD PROSPECTORS AND ONE OF THE GOLD PROSPECTORS KILLED HIS BUSINESS PARTNER. SO IT IS A RELATIONSHIP CASE ONLY. IT'S DEALING WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS.EVIDENCE WAS INTRODUCED THAT THE DEFENDANT IN THAT CASE HAD BEEN ARRESTED FOR A CRIME. THE SUPREME COURT DID NOT TELL US WHAT THE CRIME WAS IN THEIR RECITATION OF FACTS.HE -- THE BUSINESS PARTNER, THE VICTIM ARRANGED FOR A BOND FORUM ON THAT CRIME AND DEMANDED REPAYMENT.SO IT'S SIGNIFICANT FROM A COUPLE PERSPECTIVES. NUMBER ONE, IT SHOWS ECONOMIC FRICTION AS BEING THE BASIS FOR MOTIVE EVIDENCE IN A RELATIONSHIP CONTEXT AS MS. BODIN SAID. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, HERE IS WHAT THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT SAID WHERE THE ISSUE IS IDENTITY.THEY SAID:""PROOF OF SOME OTHER CRIME MAY BE GIVEN WHERE IT TENDS TO SHOW MOTIVE FOR THE HOMICIDE IN QUESTION. IN CASES WHERE THE IDENTITY OF THE PERSON WHO COMMITS A CRIME IS ATTEMPTED TO BE PROVEN BY CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE, EVIDENCE OF MOTIVE ON THE PART OF THE DEFENDANT CHARGED IS ALWAYS A SUBJECT OF PROOF AND THE FACT OF MOTIVE PARTICULARLY MATERIAL.""SO AGAIN, THIS IS PRECISELY THE RULE THAT WE ARE ASKING THE COURT TO APPLY THAT WE CAN TRACE ALL THE WAY BACK TO 1909.WE WANT TO PROVE FRICTION. WE WANT TO PROVE PROBLEMS IN THE RELATIONSHIP. WE WANT TO PROVE A PATTERN OF ABUSIVE CONTROL BECAUSE THAT PROVES MOTIVE WHICH, IN THE SUPREME COURT'S WORDS, IS ALWAYS RELEVANT FOR THE PURPOSES OF ESTABLISHING IDENTITY.NOW, THE NEXT IDENTITY CASE THAT WE HAVE IN THE CONTEXT OF RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE IS PEOPLE VERSUS MULLEN. THAT WAS A 1953 CASE AND DECIDED IN 1953.AND IN THAT CASE, THE DEFENDANT WAS ROMANTICALLY INTERESTED IN A FELLOW PRISONER. HE WAS INCARCERATED AT THE TIME. AND THE VICTIM IN THAT CASE HE PERCEIVED TO BE INTERFERING WITH THAT RELATIONSHIP.SO THIS IS A JEALOUSY CASE AND AN OBSESSION TYPE CASE, AS MS. BODIN ARGUED. AND THERE THE ISSUE WAS IDENTITY, WHO COMMITTED THE CRIME.AND THE COURT SAID:""ANTAGONISM OR ENMITY BETWEEN A DEFENDANT AND THE VICTIM OF AN ASSAULT IS ADMITTEDLY RELEVANT TO THE ISSUE OF DEFENDANT'S IDENTITY AS THE ASSAILANT.""SO THIS IS TELLING US THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF RELATIONSHIPS, WHERE THERE'S RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DEFENDANT AND THE VICTIM, THE EVIDENCE OF ANTAGONISM, ENMITY IS RELEVANT, IS ADMISSIBLE TO PROVE IDENTITY.NEXT WE HAVE PEOPLE VERSUS HELFEND, WHICH WAS A CASE WHERE THE DEFENDANT MURDERED HIS FORMER WIFE'S HUSBAND BECAUSE OF JEALOUSY WITH RESPECT TO THE WIFE APPARENTLY. AND FOUR YEARS EARLIER, THERE WERE CERTAIN ACTS OF PROPERTY DESTRUCTION. SPECIFICALLY HE HAD BURNED DOWN THE VICTIM'S HOUSE. SO AGAIN, TALKING ABOUT PROPERTY DESTRUCTION.THERE WERE ALSO OTHER TYPES OF EVIDENCE SHOWING ANTAGONISM BETWEEN THE DEFENDANT AND THE VICTIM AND THE JEALOUSY THAT EXISTED IN THAT RELATIONSHIP, AND THE COURT AGAIN HELD THAT THE EVIDENCE CAME IN.AND THEN FINALLY, PEOPLE VERSUS DANIELS WHICH WAS CITED PROMINENTLY BY THE ZACK COURT WHERE THE DEFENDANT TRIED TO -- IT WAS AN ATTEMPTED MURDER CASE ACTUALLY WHERE THE DEFENDANT TRIED TO KILL HIS SPOUSE WITH A BOMB BY BLOWING HER UP. AND THERE THEY WANTED TO INTRODUCE EVIDENCE OF PRIOR QUARRELING AND PRIOR PROBLEMS IN THE RELATIONSHIP WHICH INCLUDED PHYSICAL VIOLENCE. AND THE PHYSICAL VIOLENCE AMOUNTED TO SIMPLE ASSAULTS.AND I'M SURE THAT IF MR. UELMEN WERE ARGUING THAT, HE WOULD SAY, ""MY HEAVENS, WHAT ON EARTH DOES A SIMPLE ASSAULT HAVE TO DO WITH BLOWING SOMEONE UP? I MEAN THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO SIMILARITY AT ALL THERE.""BUT THE COURT SAID, QUOTE:""IT IS ELEMENTARY, EVIDENCE OF MOTIVE TO COMMIT AN OFFENSE IS EVIDENCE OF THE IDENTITY OF THE OFFENDER.""EVIDENCE SHOWING JEALOUSY, QUARRELS, ANTAGONISM OR ENMITY BETWEEN THE ACCUSED AND THE VICTIM OF A VIOLENT OFFENSE IS PROOF OF MOTIVE TO COMMIT THE OFFENSE,"" END QUOTE.SO WE HAVE MANY CASES WHICH HOLD THAT WE CAN INTRODUCE EVIDENCE FOR THE PURPOSES OF SHOWING IDENTITY, INCLUDING OF COURSE PEOPLE VERSUS ZACK EVEN UNDER A TRADITIONAL 1101(B) ANALYSIS. AND THESE CASES DO NOT INVOLVE SITUATIONS WHERE THE OTHER KINDS OF ACTS OF ABUSE NECESSARILY INVOLVE SIMILARITIES WITH THE CHARGED ACT AT ALL OTHER THAN THEY WERE DIRECTED AGAINST THE SAME VICTIM.NOW, THE SECOND 1101(B) THEORY THAT THE PROSECUTION HAS PRESENTED IS THAT THIS EVIDENCE IS ADMISSIBLE FOR THE PURPOSES OF PROVING MOTIVE WHICH IN TURN PROVES INTENT.AND COUNSEL SEEMED TO ARGUE THAT THE PROSECUTION IS ONLY ALLOWED TO USE THIS THEORY, IF I WAS UNDERSTANDING HIS ARGUMENT YESTERDAY, IF WE -- THEY HAVE CONCEDED THAT THE DEFENDANT COMMITTED THE CRIME AND THE ONLY ISSUE IS INTENT. THAT IS NOT TRUE. THE PROSECUTION BEARS THE BURDEN OF PROVING EVERY ELEMENT OF OUR OFFENSE.THERE ARE TWO CASES THAT CLARIFY THAT THAT IS IN FACT THE RULE. ONE IS PEOPLE VERSUS DANIELS, THAT'S 52 CAL. 3D. 815, WHERE THE SUPREME COURT SAID THAT THE DEFENDANT'S PLEA OF NOT GUILTY PUTS IN TO ISSUE ALL OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE OFFENSE AND THAT THE PROSECUTION IS ALLOWED TO INTRODUCE UNCHARGED MISCONDUCT FOR THE PURPOSES OF PROVING INTENT EVEN THOUGH THE DEFENSE HASN'T SPECIFICALLY IN SOME WAY STATED THAT THAT IS THE ONLY ISSUE INVOLVED IN THE CASE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PROVE EVERY ELEMENT OF THE OFFENSE.THE SAME EXACT OBSERVATION WAS MADE BY THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT IN ESTELLE VERSUS MC GUIRE, WHICH I'LL ADDRESS IN A CONTEXT OF A DUE PROCESS ARGUMENT THAT THE DEFENSE MADE.THE CASE THAT WE BELIEVE IS MOST INSTRUCTIVE ON THE INTENT ISSUE -- BECAUSE WHAT YOUR HONOR MAY BE WONDERING IS, WELL, WE HAVE THESE AUTOPSY PHOTOGRAPHS, WE HAVE THE CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHS. THEY VERY CLEARLY PORTRAY THAT THERE WAS A FIXED PURPOSE, FULL INTENT TO KILL, WHERE THE DEFENDANT LITERALLY WENT FOR THE JUGULAR IN THIS CASE. WHY DO WE NEED FURTHER EVIDENCE OF INTENT?AND WHAT I WOULD POINT OUT TO YOUR HONOR IS THE LAW THAT WE APPLY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH RESPECT TO PREMEDITATION BECAUSE THAT'S PRIMARILY WHERE THIS BECOMES AN ISSUE.AS YOUR HONOR KNOWS, FOR THE PURPOSES OF 1118 MOTION, FOR THE PURPOSES OF APPEAL, FOR THE PURPOSES OF A NEW TRIAL MOTION, ALTHOUGH THE JURY ISN'T INSTRUCTED ON THIS, THERE IS A THREE-PART TEST THAT WE USE IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE PURPOSES OF PREMEDITATION THAT WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE SUPREME COURT IN ANDERSON.THAT THREE-PART TEST IS THAT WE HAVE TO SHOW PLANNING ACTIVITY. WE HAVE TO SHOW MOTIVE. THAT'S THE SECOND. AND THEN THIRD, WE HAVE TO SHOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE MANNER OF THE KILLING AS INFERRED FROM THE CRIME ITSELF.NOW, THIS TEST WAS APPLIED BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT AGAIN IN THE CASE OF PEOPLE VERSUS NICHOLAS, WHICH IS INSTRUCTIVE BECAUSE THIS IS A RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASE, NICHOLAS. AND IN THAT, THE DEFENDANT KILLED HIS EX-WIFE AND THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF A BITTER AND LONG-STANDING GRUDGE THAT EXISTED BETWEEN THE TWO. IT INCLUDED WHAT COULD BE CHARACTERIZED AS STALKING EVIDENCE.IN ONE OF THE INSTANCES, THE VICTIM WAS AT A LAUNDROMAT, AND THE DEFENDANT SHOWED UP UNEXPECTEDLY, SIMILAR TO MANY OF THE INSTANCES IN OUR CASE, AND JUST STARED AT HER THROUGH THE WINDOWS OF THE LAUNDROMAT.CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT -- BY THE WAY, THIS IS A 1991 CASE -- SAID THAT ALL OF THIS EVIDENCE WAS NOT ONLY ADMISSIBLE, BUT NECESSARY. AND HERE'S WHAT THEY SAID IN APPLYING THEIR ANALYSIS.THEY TALKED ABOUT HOW UNDER ANDERSON WE HAVE TO PROVE THESE THREE ELEMENTS. AND HERE'S WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT THE SECOND ELEMENT. THIS IS THE MOTIVE ELEMENT, YOUR HONOR.THEY SAID THAT THE PROSECUTION HAD TO PROVE -- THIS IS HAD TO PROVE,"" QUOTE:""HIS MOTIVE TO KILL AS GLEANED FROM HIS PRIOR RELATIONSHIP OR CONDUCT WITH THE VICTIM,"" END QUOTE.SO THAT'S NOT SAYING ANY LONGER THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE PROSECUTION IS ENTITLED TO PROVE OR IS ALLOWED TO PROVE OR IS HELPFUL IF WE CAN PROVE THIS. THEY'RE SAYING WE HAVE TO PROVE THIS.WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO, FOR THE PURPOSES OF ESTABLISHING ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF THIS THREE-PRONG TEST, PUT IN EVIDENCE OF THE RELATIONSHIP OR CONDUCT WITH THE VICTIM IN ORDER TO GLEAN MOTIVE.THAT IS A RECENT PRONOUNCEMENT BY OUR CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT, WHICH MAKES THIS EVIDENCE NOT ONLY ADMISSIBLE, BUT MANDATORY.AND TO EXCLUDE THIS EVIDENCE, YOUR HONOR, WOULD BE ESSENTIALLY TO CONVERT EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 1101(B) FROM A SHIELD INTO A SWORD BECAUSE IT WOULD BE -- TO CONVERT EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 1101(B) AND THAT FORUM OF ANALYSIS FROM THE NORMAL ANALYSIS THAT IS DESIGNED TO PRECLUDE IRRELEVANT EVIDENCE THAT WOULD CAUSE THE JURY TO VOTE GUILTY FOR AN IMPROPER REASON AND INTO A SWORD WHICH WOULD DEPRIVE AFFIRMATIVELY THE PROSECUTION OF ESTABLISHING WHAT IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF OUR CASE, SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO PROVE.AND FOR THAT REASON, YOUR HONOR, WE SUGGEST THAT THIS EVIDENCE CLEARLY IS ADMISSIBLE TO ESTABLISH INTENT.NOW, THAT BRINGS ME TO THE THIRD PART OF THE 1101(B) ANALYSIS. AND THAT'S PRIOR COMMON PLAN, SCHEME AND DESIGN. AND I'M GOING TO RELY ON ONE CASE FOR THAT. THAT'S PEOPLE VERSUS EWOLDT. IT IS THE SAME CASE THAT AGAIN WAS RELIED ON EXTENSIVELY BY COUNSEL YESTERDAY.AS I SAID, IT'S FACTUALLY SIMILAR TO THOMAS IN THE SENSE THAT IT'S A CHILD MOLESTATION CASE. I SUPPOSE IN SOME SENSE, YOU COULD CONSIDER IT TO BE A RELATIONSHIP TYPE OF A CASE ALTHOUGH IT'S IN A SEXUAL ASSAULT CONTEXT.AND THE PROSECUTION WANTED TO INTRODUCE EVIDENCE THAT THE DEFENDANT HAD 12 YEARS, ACCORDING TO MY CALCULATIONS, EARLIER MOLESTED ANOTHER DAUGHTER WHO WAS SEPARATED IN AGE FROM THE CHARGED VICTIM. HE WAS NEVER TRIED FOR THOSE EVENTS. HE WAS NEVER CONVICTED FOR THE EARLIER CRIME.NOW, THIS CASE IS VERY INTERESTING AND IT'S VERY CURIOUS THAT COUNSEL NOT ONLY CITED BUT RELIED ON IT SO PROMINENTLY, BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THOSE CASES THAT'S KEPT IN THE PROSECUTION'S TREASURE TROVE OF FAVORITE CASES TO PULL OUT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 1101(B) ANALYSIS.IT'S PROBABLY A BAD CHOICE TACTICALLY ON THE PART OF THE DEFENSE TO HAVE RELIED SO HEAVILY ON THIS CASE BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY, WHEN I FIRST LOOKED AT THE CASE WHEN IT CAME OUT QUITE RECENTLY, WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS, THEY'VE SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED CALIFORNIA LAW ON 1101(B) EVIDENCE AND THEY HAVE CREATED THIS WHOLE NEW THEORY OF ADMISSIBILITY, THAT BEING COMMON PLAN, SCHEME AND DESIGN IN A WAY THAT DID NOT EXIST PRIOR TO EWOLDT.AND THEY SPECIFICALLY SAID THAT. AND WHAT THEY SAID IS, THEY SAID EVEN IF IDENTITY ISN'T AN ISSUE, EVEN IF INTENT ISN'T AN ISSUE, YOU STILL CAN INTRODUCE EVIDENCE ON COMMON PLAN, SCHEME AND DESIGN BECAUSE IT IS A THIRD INDEPENDENT THEORY.PRIOR TO EWOLDT, WE WERE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT WE COULD ONLY GET COMMON PLAN, SCHEME AND DESIGN EVIDENCE IF IT WAS DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO PROVE IDENTITY OR INTENT. SUPREME COURT SAYS NO, THAT'S WRONG. YOU CAN GET THIS IN AS A THIRD INDEPENDENT THEORY THAT STANDS ON ITS OWN INDEPENDENT OF THE OTHERS.NOW, COUNSEL SEEMS TO BE CITING EWOLDT -- IF AGAIN, I'M UNDERSTANDING HIS ARGUMENT -- FOR THE PROPOSITION THAT WE HAVE TO SHOW THAT ALL OF THE INCIDENTS WERE A PLAN IN THE SENSE THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO SHOW THAT WHEN THE DEFENDANT FIRST STARTED TO ABUSE NICOLE SIMPSON IN '77, '78, WHICH IS ONE OF OUR FIRST ACTS, THAT IN HIS MIND, HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF, ""WELL, YOU KNOW, GEE, I THINK I'M GOING TO START ABUSING HER NOW.""AND THEN SOMETIME AROUND 1989, ""I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A KNOCK-DOWN DRAG-OUT INCIDENT THAT WILL RESULT IN HER CALLING THE POLICE AND RUNNING OUT OF THE HOUSE WITH HER CLOTHES TORN OFF."" AND THEN AROUND DECEMBER OF '93, ""I THINK I'LL BARGE DOWN -- BREAK DOWN THE DOOR TO HER HOME AND HER BEDROOM DOOR AND CAUSE HER TO CALL 911."" AND THEN AROUND THE MIDDLE OF '94, ""I THINK I'LL KILL HER.""THAT IS CLEARLY NOT THE SENSE IN WHICH COMMON PLAN, SCHEME AND DESIGN IS USED BY THE COURTS, AND WE WERE TOLD THAT VERY CLEARLY IN EWOLDT BECAUSE HERE'S WHAT THEY SAID.EWOLDT, AS THE COURT IS PROBABLY AWARE, OVERRULED THE CASE OF PEOPLE VERSUS TASSEL, WHICH WAS A PROBLEMATIC CASE IN THE AREA OF 1101(B) EVIDENCE. AND WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT TASSEL WAS, THEY SAID THAT TASSEL WAS BASED UPON, QUOTE:""THE ERRONEOUS PREMISE THAT A COMMON DESIGN OR PLAN CANNOT BE ESTABLISHED UNLESS ALL OF THESE ACTS ARE PART OF THE SINGLE CONTINUING CONCEPTION OR PLOT,"" END QUOTE.THEY ARE MAKING IT CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT WE DO NOT HAVE TO PROVE THAT WHEN THE DEFENDANT STARTED THE ACTS OF ABUSE, HE HAD CONTEMPLATED THAT THEY WERE ALL GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY LEAD UP TO THE MURDER OF THE VICTIM.RATHER, WHAT THE COURT SAYS IN EWOLDT -- AND THIS IS AT PAGE 403. THEY SAY THAT RATHER, THE TERM SIMPLY MEANS THAT, QUOTE:""RATHER THAN A SERIES OF SIMILAR SPONTANEOUS ACTS,""END QUOTE, WE MUST SHOW A COMMON DESIGN.SO THE ISSUE IS, ARE THESE A SERIES OF SPONTANEOUS ACTS? IS IT A COINCIDENCE THAT HE JUST HAPPENED TO HAVE COMMITTED THE INCIDENTS IN 1987, '88 THAT IS TOTALLY UNRELATED TO THE 1989, THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE 1993, HAS NOTHING TO DO WHATSOEVER WITH THE MURDER? ARE THEY JUST A SERIES OF SPONTANEOUS DISCONNECTED ACTS OR RATHER, WERE THEY ALL COMMITTED WITH THE SAME DESIGN IN MIND?

BUT THE POINT IS THAT EVEN WITHOUT EXPERT TESTIMONY, WHAT THESE CASES DEMONSTRATE IS THAT WE CAN STILL USE COMMON SENSE FOR THE PURPOSES OF ALLOWING THIS EVIDENCE IN.AND I SHOULD ADD, YOUR HONOR, THAT IN THE EWOLDT CASE, I DON'T BELIEVE THERE WAS EXPERT TESTIMONY THAT WAS INTRODUCED FOR THE PURPOSES OF ALLOWING THIS COMMON PLAN, SCHEME AND DESIGN EVIDENCE IN.

DE MOSS WAS AN EARLY CASE. THEY DIDN'T USE EXPERT TESTIMONY THERE. THEY DIDN'T HAVE THIS TESTIMONY THERE.IN THAT CASE, THE DEFENDANT ALSO MADE COMMENTS TO THE EFFECT OF, ""IF I CAN'T HAVE HER, NO ONE WILL."" THESE ARE COMMENTS THAT A JURY CAN UNDERSTAND EVEN IF AN EXPERT DOESN'T EXPLAIN THEM.WE CALL IT ESTRANGEMENT. WE USE NEW LABELS NOW THAT COME FROM THE EMPIRICAL LITERATURE AND THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE.BUT EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE CONCEPT OF, ""IF I CAN'T HAVE HER, NO ONE WILL.""WE SAY IT IS ESTRANGEMENT NOW, BUT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND IT ON A COMMON SENSE LEVEL. YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WAS A MAN WHO HAD THE ABSOLUTE NEED TO CONTROL THIS WOMAN IN EVERY ASPECT OF HER LIFE.YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A MAN WHO WAS VERY ABUSIVE TOWARDS THIS WOMAN WITHOUT AN EXPERT AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHEN IT FINALLY BECAME APPARENT TO HIM THAT HE WAS GOING TO LOSE HER, THAT EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD DONE IN THE PAST THAT HAD WORKED FOR THE PURPOSES OF CONTROLLING HER, THAT HAD KEPT HER WITH HIM, THAT HAD PREVENTED HER FROM LEAVING WAS NO LONGER WORKING.AND AROUND THE TIME THAT SHE SENT THAT MESSAGE TO SOJOURN, AROUND THE TIME THAT SHE MADE THE COMMENTS THAT MADE IT CLEAR, ""I AM FINALLY GOING TO CUT OFF THIS RELATIONSHIP,"" A JURY CAN UNDERSTAND THAT HIS ONLY -- THE ONLY THING THAT WAS LEFT FOR HIM TO DO AT THAT POINT WAS TO KILL HER.I MEAN HE HAD TRIED EVERYTHING ELSE. HE HAD TRIED EVERYTHING THAT COMMON SENSE WOULD INDICATE THAT YOU CAN DO TO CONTROL SOMEONE.HE TRIED TO TAKE AWAY HER SENSE OF PERSONAL DIGNITY THROUGH THE BELITTLEMENT, THROUGH THE NAME CALLING. HE TOOK AWAY HER SENSE OF FINANCIAL SECURITY THROUGH THE IRS LETTER. HE TOOK AWAY HER SENSE OF PHYSICAL SECURITY THROUGH THE ABUSE AND THE VIOLENCE. AND THEN WHEN THERE WASN'T ANYTHING ELSE THAT HE COULD THINK OF TO TAKE AWAY FROM HER, HE TOOK AWAY HER LIFE.AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT IS THE KIND OF A FACT PATTERN THAT A JURY CAN UNDERSTAND AND CAN APPRECIATE. THEY DO HAVE TO BRING THEIR OWN LIFE EXPERIENCES AND THEIR COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCES TO BEAR ON A CASE LIKE THIS, THE COMMUNITY WISDOM.I THINK WHEN YOU DO THAT -- WHEN THEY DO THAT, THEY CAN UNDERSTAND THE EVIDENCE.I'M NOT SAYING THAT EXPERT TESTIMONY WOULD BE INSTRUCTIVE OR RELEVANT. I THINK IT WOULD. MR. GORDON IS GOING TO DISCUSS THAT FURTHER. I'M SIMPLY SAYING THAT IT'S NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.YOUR HONOR, I'D INTENDED NOW TO SWITCH TO THE ISSUE OF DUE PROCESS, WHICH ISN'T GOING TO TAKE ME VERY LONG, AND I MAY GET INTO 352 UNLESS THE COURT HAD SOME FURTHER QUESTIONS BEFORE WE LEFT COMMON PLAN, SCHEME AND DESIGN.

#MR. GOLDBERG: ,"THANK YOU.NOW, THE ISSUE OF DUE PROCESS I DON'T WANT TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON BECAUSE COUNSEL DIDN'T ARGUE IT EXTENSIBLY.WE BELIEVE THAT THE MATTER IS ABSOLUTELY CONVINCINGLY DISPOSED OF IN ESTELLE VERSUS MC GUIRE. THAT'S A UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT CASE WHICH, INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, IS A RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASE IN THE SENSE THAT THE DEFENDANT WAS CHARGED WITH THE MURDER OF HIS INFANT CHILD.THERE WAS TESTIMONY VERY SIMILAR TO THE TESTIMONY THAT WE HEARD HERE TODAY FROM A NEIGHBOR THAT HEARD -- OVERHEARD THE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES THAT SHE ASSOCIATED WITH ABUSING THE CHILD. IT WASN'T DESCRIBED IN THAT MUCH DETAIL BY THE SUPREME COURT, UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.THERE WAS EVIDENCE IN THAT CASE THAT THE CHILD HAD SUFFERED A SEVEN-WEEK OLD RIB FRACTURE AND A SIX-WEEK OLD RECTAL TEAR. AND ALL OF THAT WAS INTRODUCED UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW.IT ORIGINATED IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE PURPOSES OF DEMONSTRATING UNDER 1101(B) THE IDENTITY OF THE PERPETRATOR BECAUSE THE QUESTION WAS, WHO COMMITTED THIS CRIME, PERPETRATED THIS CRIME ON THIS CHILD.AND THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SAYS BASICALLY, ""ONCE THE EVIDENCE HAS COME IN UNDER STATE EVIDENTIARY PROVISION, WE ARE NOT GOING TO REEVALUATE IT UNDER THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE. THAT'S IT.""ONCE IT IS DETERMINED TO BE RELEVANT UNDER EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 1101(B), OUR ANALYSIS IS FINISHED. THERE IS NO DUE PROCESS ANALYSIS, WHICH MEANS THAT THE ONLY CONCERNS THAT ARE IN FRONT OF YOUR HONOR LEGALLY SPEAKING ARE CALIFORNIA EVIDENTIARY LAW; IN OTHER WORDS, THE RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASES AND 1101(B) AND THEN 352. AND ONCE YOUR HONOR DISPOSES OF THOSE ISSUES, THERE IS NO INDEPENDENT DUE PROCESS ARGUMENT. AND MC GUIRE MAKES THAT VERY CLEAR.

#THE COURT: ,"WELL, IT'S PROBABLY ALSO BECAUSE FEDERAL RULES 403 AND 404 ARE VIRTUALLY CARBON COPIES OF CALIFORNIA'S.
","JANUARY 12, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
#MR. GOLDBERG: ,"THAT'S CORRECT.FINALLY, EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 352.THERE WERE SEVERAL 352 ARGUMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY COUNSEL. I AGAIN POINT BACK TO THE STATUTE ITSELF, 352, BECAUSE WE TEND TO USE SHORTHAND TERMS TO DESCRIBE IT.AND SOMETIMES WE HEAR ATTORNEYS SAYING MORE PREJUDICIAL THAN PROBATIVE. I BELIEVE I HEARD MR. UELMEN USING THE PHRASE JUST PREJUDICIAL. HE CUT OUT THE PROBATIVE PART ALTOGETHER. BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT THE STATUTE SAYS. I MEAN, BOTH ARE MISSTATEMENTS.IT SAYS THAT IT'S GOT TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE PREJUDICIAL THAN PROBATIVE. AND I CALL THE COURT'S ATTENTION AND RELY ON THAT WORD ""SUBSTANTIALLY"" BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT WHENEVER WE'RE ENGAGING IN 352 ANALYSIS, BECAUSE WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT IF IT'S A CLOSE CASE, PROSECUTION WINS.OR EVEN IF WE WERE TO IMAGINE -- AND I'M NOT SUGGESTING THIS IS THE CASE. IT VERY CLEARLY ISN'T. IF THE COURT WERE OF THE MIND SET IT'S SLIGHTLY MORE PREJUDICIAL THAN PROBATIVE, WE STILL WIN BECAUSE UNLESS IT'S SUBSTANTIALLY MORE PREJUDICIAL THAN PROBATIVE, IT IS NOT EXCLUDABLE UNDER 352.I WANTED TO DIGRESS FOR JUST ONE SECOND IN THE 352 ARGUMENT, AND THAT WAS TO MENTION THE CHART THAT WE PREPARED FOR YOUR HONOR TODAY. YOUR HONOR DIRECTED US TO PREPARE SOMETHING IN WRITING THAT SYNTHESIZED THE EVIDENCE.AS MS. BODIN POINTED OUT AT THE VERY, VERY BEGINNING OF HER ANALYSIS AND I BELIEVE MR. GORDON MAY HAVE -- I'M NOT POSITIVE -- ALL OF THE ITEMS THAT WERE CONTAINED IN THE DOCUMENT OF THE PROSECUTION'S BRIEF, WE DID NOT TAKE THE POSITION THAT ALL OF THEM WERE ADMISSIBLE IN OUR CASE IN CHIEF. WE SAID WE UNDERSTAND THAT IS NOT THE CASE. THEY MAY BE ADMISSIBLE FOR OTHER PURPOSES, AND THAT WE WANTED TO TAKE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIRST LAY OUT EVERYTHING THAT WE KNEW ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP AND WE ALSO WANTED TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT THE DEFENDANT ON NOTICE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT AS TO THE KINDS OF EVIDENCE THAT WE WERE SEEKING TO INTRODUCE AND ALSO BECAUSE THIS MIGHT COME UP IN SOME OTHER CONTEXT.WHAT WE WERE DIRECTED TO DO -- AND WE WERE ALL VERY TIRED LAST NIGHT AFTER THE EVENTS IN COURT AND WE WERE WORKING ON THIS -- THE DOCUMENT THAT YOUR HONOR HAD ASKED US TO, WE WERE TRYING TO ASK OURSELVES WHAT IT IS EXACTLY THAT THE JUDGE HAS ASKED US TO DO.AND OUR INTERPRETATION WAS, HE IS ASKING US TO ELIMINATE THOSE, TO SPECIFY WHICH ELEMENTS WE DO NOT BELIEVE ARE ADMISSIBLE RATHER THAN JUST MAKING A GENERAL STATEMENT.AND IT WAS ALSO OUR INTERPRETATION THAT IN ESSENCE, WHAT THE COURT WAS IN A SENSE ASKING US TO DO WAS TO ENGAGE -- AND I MAY BE WRONG IN THIS -- BUT TO ENGAGE IN OUR OWN 352 ANALYSIS AND TO TAKE CERTAIN ITEMS WHERE THERE MIGHT BE EXTENSIVE CROSS-EXAMINATION OR EXTENSIVE IMPEACHMENT OR SO ON THAT WOULDN'T BE AS PROBATIVE TO THE PROSECUTION'S CASE AND LINE THOSE THROUGH.AND THAT WAS OUR INTERPRETATION OF WHAT THE COURT WANTED. SO TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT THE COURT DOESN'T HAVE TO OBVIOUSLY ENGAGE IN ITS OWN ANALYSIS OR THAT THE COURT CAN RELY ON THE PROSECUTION. I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT AT ALL. I'M JUST SAYING THAT IN MANY RESPECTS, WE WENT THROUGH LAST NIGHT THE SAME KIND OF ANALYSIS THAT YOUR HONOR IS GOING TO BE GOING THROUGH.NOW, THE ISSUE OF PREJUDICE HAS ALSO BEEN WELL DEFINED BY THE CASE LAW. AND WE KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN BY THAT TERM. THEY DON'T MEAN EVIDENCE WHICH TENDS TO INCRIMINATE THE DEFENDANT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY ALL EVIDENCE THAT WE'RE INTRODUCING IS SUPPOSED TO ACCOMPLISH THAT END.IT HAS BEEN DEFINED BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT IN PEOPLE VERSUS THOMPSON -- I CAN'T RECALL WHETHER WE CITED THAT IN OUR CASE. IT'S AT 27 CAL. 3D. AT PAGE 317 -- 27 CAL. 3D. 317 WHERE THEY SAID THAT:""IT IS THE TENDENCY TO CONDEMN NOT BECAUSE HE IS BELIEVED GUILTY OF THE PRESENT CHARGE, BUT BECAUSE HE HAS ESCAPED UNPUNISHED FROM OTHER OFFENSES,"" END QUOTE.AND THAT IS ALSO REFLECTED IN THE CASE OF EWOLDT.SO THE IDEA IS THAT IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE JURY MAY DEVELOP THE MIND SET THAT, ""THIS GUY HAS GOTTEN AWAY WITH THIS KIND OF THING BEFORE, AND I'M NOT REALLY SURE THAT HE'S GUILTY NOW, BUT I WANT TO PUNISH HIM FOR WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE. SO I AM GOING TO VOTE GUILTY ANYWAY.""THAT IS THE KIND OF STATE OF MIND THAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PREJUDICE IN THE CONTEXT OF 352 AND 1101(B) CASES.NOW, IF THERE WAS EVER A CASE WHERE YOU WOULD THINK THAT WOULD BE TRUE, YOU WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE PEOPLE VERSUS EWOLDT, WHERE, ACCORDING TO MY CALCULATION, I THINK THERE WAS 12 YEARS -- AND I DID IT BASED ON THE AGES OF THE CHILDREN. SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT I COULD BE A LITTLE BIT OFF, BUT PROBABLY NOT FAR -- THERE WAS 12 YEARS BETWEEN THE ACTS OF MOLESTATION OF THE FIRST CHILD AND ACTS OF MOLESTATION IN THE CHARGED OFFENSE, AND HE WAS NEVER TRIED AND CONVICTED OF THE PRIOR OFFENSE.AND COUNSEL CITED THIS FOR THE PROPOSITION -- THIS CASE FOR THE PROPOSITION DEFINING PREJUDICE THE WAY THAT I JUST HAVE. AND YOU WOULD THINK FROM THAT THAT EWOLDT SAID, WELL, FOR CRYIN' OUT LOUD, WE CAN'T ALLOW THIS EVIDENCE.I MEAN, IF THERE'S EVER A CASE WHERE THERE'S GOING TO BE PREJUDICE, THE FACT THEY KNOW THIS GUY IS ESSENTIALLY A PERVERT WHO DID EXACTLY THE SAME THING 12 YEARS EARLIER AND WAS NEVER PUNISHED FOR IT MIGHT CAUSE THEM TO VOTE GUILTY HERE. YET, THE COURT NEVERTHELESS FOUND THAT THE PRIOR INSTANCE WAS GOING TO COME IN.WHAT IS SIGNIFICANT HERE IN THIS ANALYSIS, YOUR HONOR, IS THE -- IN A WAY, THE VERY ARGUMENTS OF COUNSEL YESTERDAY UNDERCUT HIS 352 ARGUMENT BECAUSE TO THE EXTENT THAT HE HAS ARGUED THAT THESE INSTANCES CAN BE MINIMIZED, EXPLAINED, THAT THEY'RE AMBIGUOUS, THEY DON'T REALLY PROVE WHAT WE SAY THAT THEY PROVE, ARE WE REALLY TALKING ABOUT A CASE WHERE THE JURY IS GOING TO SAY, ""GEE, I REALLY DON'T THINK ORENTHAL SIMPSON COMMITTED THAT MURDER. BUT HE DID SO MANY OTHER BAD THINGS THAT HE WASN'T CONVICTED OF, I'M JUST GOING TO CONVICT HIM OF A DOUBLE HOMICIDE ANYWAY""?BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT HERE. AND I DON'T THINK THAT A REASONABLE INTERPRETATION OF THE KINDS OF EVIDENCE THAT WE ARE SEEKING TO INTRODUCE IS -- LENDS ITSELF TO THAT KIND OF FEAR OR THAT KIND OF CONCERN.THE NEXT 352 TYPE OF ARGUMENT THAT WAS MADE WAS THE ISSUE OF TIME CONSUMPTION AND JUDICIAL EFFICIENCY. AND I JUST POINT OUT THAT ALL OF THESE RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASES SINCE 1909 ALLOWED THIS KIND OF EVIDENCE. AND OBVIOUSLY THEY IMPLIEDLY DECIDED THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO ALLOW IN, NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT IT TAKES TIME TO PROVE THESE PRIOR INSTANCES.

AND THAT IS TRUE THAT WE HAVE MANY INSTANCES. BUT IT ALSO IN A SENSE, YOUR HONOR, HELPS US OUT ON THE 352 CONCERN.BECAUSE THE ARGUMENT AGAINST THE ADMISSION OF THE EVIDENCE, ONE OF THE STRONGEST ARGUMENTS WOULD BE, IF YOU COULD SAY, THIS IS JUST AN ISOLATED INSTANCE, IF THERE WERE ONE SLAP AT ONE POINT IN THE HISTORY OF A RELATIONSHIP, THEN YOU COULD ARGUE UNDER 352, WELL, DOES THIS REALLY SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP ITSELF?WHAT THE PROSECUTION HAS SAID THAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS, WE ARE TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THIS RELATIONSHIP. WE ARE USING THE SPECIFIC INSTANCES TO ALLOW THE JURY TO MAKE CERTAIN INFERENCES AND DEDUCTIONS ABOUT THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIP IT WAS.AND THE VERY FACT THAT IT DID GO OVER AN EXTENSIVE PERIOD OF TIME COMPLETELY ELIMINATES ANY ARGUMENT THAT THIS WAS SOME SORT OF TRANSITORY PROBLEM THAT EXISTED, WAS LIMITED TO A YEAR OR TWO AND WENT AWAY. IT COMPLETELY ELIMINATES ANY ARGUMENT OR ANY INFERENCE OTHER THAN THAT THIS WAS AN INALIENABLE PART OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DEFENDANT AND THE VICTIM IN THIS CASE.SO IN MANY WAYS, YES, YOUR HONOR, WE DO HAVE MANY INSTANCES. AND THAT MEANS THAT IT WILL TAKE MORE TIME, BUT IT ALSO MEANS THAT THE EVIDENCE IS MUCH MORE PROBATIVE, AND THEREFORE, WE MAKE A MUCH BETTER SHOWING ON THE PROBATIVE SIDE OF THIS TWO-PART 352 SCALE.AND WHAT I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT HERE IS THAT THE TIME CONSUMPTION CASES TYPICALLY ARE DEALING WITH SITUATIONS WHERE THE EVIDENCE IS COLLATERAL, WHERE IT DOESN'T GO TO THE HEART OF THE ISSUE. WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS THAT FUNDAMENTALLY, THIS IS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MURDER. THE RELATIONSHIP IS ITSELF PART OF THE TRANSACTION IN THIS CASE AND EXPLAINS WHAT HAPPENED.THIS IS THE CASE. THIS ISN'T SOME SIDE ISSUE, NOT LIKE A CREDIBILITY ISSUE WHICH IS A COLLATERAL TYPE OF ISSUE IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. IT GOES TO THE VERY HEART AND CORE. THE SUPREME COURT IN NICHOLAS SAID, ACTUALLY GOES TO ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF OUR CHARGE.I GUESS THAT THE DEFENDANT WILL PROBABLY SPEND MONTHS AND MONTHS ON THE DNA EVIDENCE AND THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE ON THAT CASE, CROSS EXAMINE AD NAUSEAM, AND I THINK IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO A CERTAIN EXTENT TO CUT A LOT OF THAT OUT UNDER 352 BECAUSE AGAIN, IT REALLY DOES GO TO A VERY SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE CASE.AND USUALLY WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, 352, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT STUFF THAT'S COLLATERAL. AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT I HEAR IN THE ARGUMENT WHEN MR. UELMEN IS TALKING ABOUT TIME CONSUMPTION -- THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CALL ALL THESE WITNESSES, REBUTTAL, CROSS-EXAMINE -- IS ALMOST A FORM OF LEGAL BLACKMAIL.THAT IS TO SAY TO THE JUDGE, YOUR HONOR, WE ARE GOING TO PUT ON SO MUCH EVIDENCE AND HAVE SO MUCH CROSS-EXAMINATION OF THESE WITNESSES THAT UNDER THIS TIME-CONSUMPTION CONCERN, WE SHOULD EXCLUDE THE EVIDENCE.AND I JUST DON'T BELIEVE, YOUR HONOR, THAT IT'S PROPER TO MAKE THAT KIND OF ARGUMENT OR THAT YOUR HONOR OR THE PEOPLE SHOULD BE IN A SENSE HELD HOSTAGE BY WHAT THE DEFENSE PROPOSES TO DO.

I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THAT ARGUMENT OR I'M NOT CONCERNED THAT THAT ARGUMENT WOULD BE CONSTRUED AS BEING BLACKMAIL OR HOLDING THE COURT HOSTAGE OR WHATEVER. BUT I DO HAVE A VERY PRACTICAL PROBLEM.THAT I'VE GOT 24 JURORS PROBABLY PLAYING TIDDLEDYWINKS RIGHT NOW WITH EACH OTHER.

AND ALL I'M SAYING IS, WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TIME-CONSUMPTION ISSUES, THAT WE ARE TYPICALLY TALKING ABOUT CASES AND SCENARIOS WHERE THE EVIDENCE IN QUESTION DOESN'T GO TO THE HEART OF THE MATTER.THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO TAKE TIME IN THIS CASE.

#MR. GOLDBERG: ,"OKAY.FINALLY, I'D JUST LIKE TO ADDRESS THE REMOTENESS ISSUE. THAT'S MY LAST 352 ISSUE, AND THEN I'LL BE FINISHED.IS THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CASES THAT DEAL WITH REMOTENESS. ONE WAS PEOPLE VERSUS SHAVER, WHERE THE DEFENDANT MURDERED HIS WIFE, AND EVIDENCE WAS INTRODUCED THAT TWO YEARS BEFORE, HE FALSELY ACCUSED HIS WIFE OF SLEEPING WITH ANOTHER MAN. AND IN THE INTERVENING TWO YEARS, THE COURT SAID THAT INSOFAR AS THE RECORD WAS CONCERNED, THERE WERE NO PROBLEMS AT ALL.SO THAT WOULD SEEM TO BE A PROBLEMATIC CASE IN THE SENSE THAT YOU HAVE THAT TWO-YEAR GAP, SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY DON'T HAVE IN OUR CASE.BUT THE COURT HELD THAT REMOTENESS OF THIS EVIDENCE MIGHT LESSEN ITS WEIGHT, BUT DID NOT RENDER INADMISSIBLE. SO IT'S AN ISSUE THAT GOES TO WEIGHT, NOT ADMISSIBILITY.WE HAD PEOPLE VERSUS HELFEND, WHICH I ALREADY DISCUSSED.THAT WAS THE CASE WHERE THE EX-HUSBAND KILLED HIS WIFE'S NEW HUSBAND. AND THE EVIDENCE THERE WAS FOUR YEARS OLD. AND THAT OF COURSE, THE EWOLDT CASE ITSELF WHERE THE EVIDENCE WAS 12 YEARS OLD, AND IT WAS ALLOWED IN NEVERTHELESS.MAY I JUST HAVE A MOMENT, YOUR HONOR, TO REVIEW MY NOTES?

#MR. GOLDBERG: ,"OKAY.BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY STRESS THERE AND I THINK IT IS JUST A POINT THAT THE COURT -- I WOULD ASK THE COURT TO CONSIDER IN YOUR HONOR'S ANALYSIS. AND I'M NOT SAYING THE COURT DOESN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH ITS ANALYSIS. YOU DO.THE THING THAT THEY MENTION IN EWOLDT WHERE THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT REMOTENESS, THEY SAID, ""LOOK, WE KNOW THIS IS 12 YEARS OLD. BUT WHAT WE FIND TO BE SIGNIFICANT IS THAT SHORTLY AFTER THE DEFENDANT STOPPED MOLESTING THE OLDER CHILD, HE STARTED MOLESTING THE YOUNGER CHILD.""SO THERE WASN'T A GAP. SO THAT LEADS ME TO CONCLUDE FROM THAT CASE AND FROM OTHERS THAT WHAT THE COURTS ARE PRIMARILY CONCERNED ABOUT ARE GAPS. NOT NECESSARILY HOW OLD THE EVIDENCE IS, BUT ARE THERE ANY REAL GAPS OF A LENGTHY PERIOD OF TIME THAT SHOWS PERHAPS THE DEFENDANT'S CHARACTER HAS CHANGED IN BETWEEN THE TIME THE EARLIER EVENTS OCCURRED AND THE LATER EVENTS OCCURRED.AND AS I SAID, YOUR HONOR, I UNDERSTAND THE COURT'S ARGUMENT THAT YEAH, IT'S OLDER; THEREFORE, LESS PROBATIVE. BUT THERE'S A COUNTERVAILING ARGUMENT; AND THAT COUNTERVAILING ARGUMENT IS THE FACT THAT WE CAN SHOW THAT THIS WAS A PART OF THE RELATIONSHIP WHICH EXISTED AT THE GENESIS OF THE RELATIONSHIP. IT WAS A PART OF THE RELATIONSHIP WHICH EXISTED WHEN THE DEFENDANT PHYSICALLY TERMINATED THE RELATIONSHIP BY KILLING THE VICTIM, AND EVERYWHERE IN-BETWEEN MAKES THE EVIDENCE INFINITELY MORE PROBATIVE THAN IT WOULD OTHERWISE BE BECAUSE IT REALLY DOES KNOW THAT THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL, AS I SAY, INALIENABLE ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DEFENDANT AND NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON.I JUST RECEIVED A NOTE ON THE ZACK ANALYSIS, WHICH INDICATES THAT THE ANSWER, ONE OF THE ANSWERS TO YOUR HONOR'S QUESTION IS THAT ZACK WAS A RETRIAL, AT WHICH THE COURT GRANTED THE PEOPLE'S MOTION TO HAVE THE EVIDENCE INTRODUCED IN ITS CASE IN CHIEF.SO THAT WOULD -- IF TRUE -- AND I HATE EVER SAYING SOMETHING WITHOUT RELOOKING AGAIN -- WOULD DISPOSE OF THAT CONCERN.

","JANUARY 12, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
#MR. GORDON: ,"I WANT TO ADDRESS A COUPLE ISSUES TO THE COURT.THE FIRST ONE RELATES TO WHAT THE SOCIAL SCIENCE ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN ARGUED IN THIS MOTION AND BY THE DEFENSE IN THEIR BRIEF AND HOW THEY ARE RELEVANT TO SEVERAL NOTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ARGUED BACK AND FORTH AND ARE VERY KEY TO THE COURT MAKING ITS DECISION HERE. SO PRESENT SOME INFORMATION TO THE COURT WITH REGARD TO A LOT OF THE ISSUES WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IN THE EMPIRICAL REALM TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS HERE. SO ISOLATED SOLELY TO THIS MOTION, HOPEFULLY GIVE THE ORDER SOME EVIDENCE WITH REGARD TO THAT.THEN SECONDLY, GOING TO ANALYSIS WITH REGARD TO THE USES OF EXPERT TESTIMONY IN A TRIAL IN THIS MATTER AND ADDRESS SOME OF THE COURT'S CONCERNS WITH REGARD TO 1107.AND WITH REGARD TO THE USE OF EXPERT TESTIMONY, AGAIN, I THINK THIS IS A POINT SIMILAR TO RAISING THE MULTIPLE ISSUES YESTERDAY.WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THAT THE INTRODUCTION OF EXPERT TESTIMONY WITHIN THIS TYPE OF TRIAL OR A SEXUAL ASSAULT TRIAL OR CHILD ABUSE TRIAL CAN BE TRIGGERED BY SEVERAL DIFFERENT THINGS WITHIN A TRIAL. AND I THINK THERE ARE FOUR DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES WE HAVE TO CONSIDER IN THE TRIAL.ONE IS WHAT I CALL KIND OF THE PHILLIPS, CEGERS, MCALPIN ANALYSIS THAT TALK ABOUT WHAT IS USED IN CASE IN CHIEF.SECOND IS THE TRADITIONAL BLEDSOE, BALKER ARIS ANALYSIS WHICH IS MORE OF A REBUTTAL TYPE OF USE OF AN EXPERT WHICH CAN OCCUR IN THE CASE IN CHIEF OR IN REBUTTAL, DEPENDING WHAT OCCURS BY THE DEFENSE, DEPENDING UPON THE CROSS-EXAMINATION, ARGUMENTS, WHAT INFERENCES ARE RAISED WHEN THAT TRIAL OCCURRED.AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I THINK WE BROUGHT THIS UP IN THIS BRIEF NOW IS -- AND TO ARGUE AND PUT THIS BEFORE THE COURT NOW, THAT MANY OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT WERE MADE, ESPECIALLY THE SOCIAL SCIENCE ARGUMENTS, BUT MANY OF THE ARGUMENTS MADE IN THE DEFENDANT'S BRIEF AND CERTAINLY THE ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE YESTERDAY BY DEAN UELMEN ARE EXACTLY, EXACTLY THE KIND OF MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT WHAT OCCURS TO A BATTERED WOMAN, WHICH REFERS TO ADDRESSED BY LENORE WALKER IN 1979 IN THIS BOOK, THE BATTERED WOMAN, WHICH HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED IN NUMEROUS CASES BY THE COURT AND BY THE LEGISLATURE.SO IF THOSE ARE QUOTED HERE WITH EXPECTATION THAT THOSE WILL BE EXACTLY THE SAME KIND OF ARGUMENTS IN CROSS-EXAMINATION THAT WOULD OCCUR IN THIS CASE, IT WOULD TRIGGER -- SO MUCH OF THAT IS GEARED TOWARD THAT. AND WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT THERE MAY BE A TRIGGERING MECHANISM THAT MUST OCCUR.NEXT IS 1107 AND THE EFFECT OF 1107 ON THIS AREA IN GENERAL.AND THEN LASTLY IS A STOLL SITUATION WHICH, AS IN PEOPLE VERSUS STOLL, AGAIN REQUIRING THE TRIGGERING MIGHT OCCUR DEPENDING ON THE DEFENSE WOULD BRING FORTH EXPERT TESTIMONY IN THEIR CASE. I'M NOT GOING TO ADDRESS THAT ONE. I JUST WANTED TO BRING IT TO THE COURT'S ATTENTION BECAUSE IT'S A SEPARATE SITUATION THAT MAY OCCUR, AND WE CAN TAKE IT UP AT THAT TIME. BUT I DO THINK WE NEED TO LIKE -- WE NEED TO ANALYZE THESE IN THESE DISCREET SECTIONS.AND IT'S VERY, VERY IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER WHAT'S OCCURRING HERE IN THIS MOTION AND SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT ARE BEING MADE AND WHAT THEY ARE BEING SAID BOTH IN A LEGAL WAY, WHEN THE COURT MAKES ITS DETERMINATION, THE FACTS THAT THE COURT IS GOING TO BE BASING IT ON, BUT ALSO SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT POLICY ARGUMENTS.AS DEAN UELMEN WAS CARRYING HIS FILE AROUND WE'VE BEEN HEARING A LOT ABOUT, I MYSELF WASN'T QUITE FAR ALONG. I WAS AT THE LOWER END OF THE -- LOWER IS NOT THE WORD -- THE END OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ON THE STREET PUSHING A PATROL CAR AROUND.AND I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OUT THERE. AND A COUPLE THINGS I LEARNED AS A POLICE OFFICER, PATROLMAN OUT THERE WAS, ONE, TO BE REAL CAREFUL AT THOSE CALLS BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY DANGEROUS AND VERY VIOLENT, EXPLOSIVE SITUATIONS.NUMBER TWO, WHAT I LEARNED IS IF IN MY BEAT THERE WAS A HOUSE OR DOMESTIC VIOLENCES GOING ON, UNLESS I INTERVENED, I WAS GOING TO BE SPENDING A LOT OF TIMES THERE BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO GET CALLS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.AND THE OTHER THING I LEARNED WAS THAT SOME OF THE WORST ASSAULTS THAT I SAW, SOME OF THE WORST HOMICIDES I SAW AS A PATROLMAN WERE OUT OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CALLS. I LEARNED THAT AS A COP OUT ON THE STREET AND SQUATTED ALL MY TIME ON PATROL.AND WHAT KIND OF AMAZED ME WHEN I CAME INTO COURT, WHERE WE TAKE A MUCH MORE SCHOLARLY APPROACH HOPEFULLY TO THINGS THAN SAY PATROLMEN DO OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT TALKING ABOUT THINGS, AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO -- BUT WHAT I SAW IS THAT OF THE REALITIES THAT I LEARNED OUT THERE WERE NOT ONLY IGNORED, BUT IN FACT WERE TRIVIALIZED AND MINIMIZED IN COURT AND OCCURRED ALL THE TIME. THAT'S JUST THE KIND OF THING WE'RE HEARING YESTERDAY.WHAT HAPPENS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO WOMEN IN THIS SOCIETY IS, WE SAY, LOOK, WE UNDERSTAND THAT BATTERING IS A PROBLEM, AND YOU NEED TO BRING THAT PROBLEM WITHIN THIS SYSTEM. AND WHEN YOU GET IN THE SYSTEM, WE ARE -- THIS IS THE PLACE TO TAKE CARE OF IT. THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS GOING TO RESPOND TO IT.AND THEN LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE JUST IN THIS MOTION TODAY.IN THE WORST POSSIBLE SITUATION FOR BATTERED WOMAN, AND WHEN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE DIDN'T RESPOND ADEQUATELY, IT RESULTED IN HER DEATH.WE ARE HERE AND THIS ARGUMENT IS REVOLVING AROUND WHETHER THOSE EXPERIENCES WHICH GO TO THE VERY HEART AND DRIVE EVERY SINGLE THING THAT OCCURRED IN THIS CASE EVEN COME HERE, EVEN COME IN BEFORE THIS JURY WHO WILL BE JUDGING THE BATTERER WHO TOOK THIS WOMAN'S LIFE, WHETHER THEY COME IN OR NOT. AND I THINK THOSE ARE POLICY CONSIDERATIONS THAT NEED TO BE KIND OF IMPRINTED OVER THIS.NOW, WITH REGARD TO THE SOCIAL SCIENCE ARGUMENT THAT IS PRESENTED BY THE DEFENSE -- AND THERE IS AN ARGUMENT THAT WAS PRESENTED THAT THIS BASICALLY IS NUMERIC ANALYSIS, THAT THE COURT CANNOT -- SHOULD NOT CONSIDER SIMILARITIES. THIS IS WITHOUT GETTING TO THE POWER AND CONTROL WHEEL AT ALL. IT'S JUST ON A VERY NUMERIC SIMILARITY.THAT -- THERE'S TWO -- I THINK THE NUMBERS WERE, THERE WERE 2.5 MILLION WOMEN BATTERED IN THE UNITED STATES LAST YEAR AND THERE WERE ONLY -- AND I ABSOLUTELY HATED READING THAT WORD AND I DON'T LIKE SAYING IT, BUT THERE WAS ONLY 2,000 WOMEN THAT WERE KILLED; THEREFORE, THERE'S NO CONNECTION.THERE'S A COUPLE PROBLEMS FROM THAT ANALYSIS.NUMBER ONE IS, JUST LOGICALLY, TO USE THE SAME ANALYSIS, ONE COULD ARGUE THAT WELL, THERE'S HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OCCURRENCES OF SEX WITHIN THIS COUNTRY EVERY YEAR; YET ONLY A FRACTION OF THE PEOPLE ENGAGING IN SEX GET PREGNANT.NO LINKS THERE. THAT'S THE SAME KIND OF ANALYSIS THAT'S BEING MADE.WHAT THE DEFENSE HAS DONE -- WHAT PRODDER (PHONETIC) SHOWS US IN HIS ANALYSIS, WHAT HE HAS DONE, HE'S TAKEN SOMETHING CALLED THE CONFLICT TACTIC SCALE. AND THAT IS A SCALE THAT IS USED TO EVALUATE ABUSIVENESS BY A BATTERER TOWARDS HIS OR HER SPOUSE. THERE ARE MULTIPLE, MULTIPLE FACTS ALONG THAT SCALE THAT MEASURE THE LEVEL OF BATTERING.HE USED ONE, ONE OF THE FACTORS OUT OF THAT AND THEN SAID, ""THAT'S THE POPULATION THAT WE'RE GOING TO COMPARE. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE ONE PERSON WHICH HAS ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL CONTACT AT ALL, THAT ONE ELEMENT, AND THAT IS THE BASE POPULATION OF BATTERERS WE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT COMPARED TO HOMICIDES.""THAT'S NOT THE WAY YOU DO THAT. IF YOU JUST USE THAT ONE SCALE, THE CONFLICT TACTIC SCALE, AND YOU SEE MULTIPLE, MULTIPLE FACTORS, PRESENTING EVIDENCE HOPEFULLY LATER TO DESTROY A MORE DETAIL OF THAT, YOU REDUCE THAT POPULATION GEOMETRY TO GET DOWN TO THE POPULATION THAT SHOULD BE COMPARED.BUT THAT'S NOT -- YOU GET TO SOMETHING CALLED THE TOTAL LOP SCALE, AND THE SCALE IS A SCALE THAT THERE'S EMOTIONAL ABUSE THAT IS ADDED ON TOP OF THAT.AND WHEN YOU HAVE INSTANCES OF EMOTIONAL ABUSE ON TOP OF THE PHYSICAL ACTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED WITHIN THE CONFLICT TACTIC SCALE, YOU HAVE EVEN A SMALLER POPULATION, ONCE AGAIN DECREASING THAT POPULATION THAT'S COMPARED TO HOMICIDES AND INCREASING THE FREQUENCY OR NUMBERS, IF THEY WANT TO USE NUMBER GEOMETRY.YOU THEN GO TO A DOCUMENT CALLED INTRUSIVENESS SCALE. AND THE INTRUSIVENESS SCALE MEASURES STALKING.STALKING IS AN PHENOMENALLY, PHENOMENALLY IMPORTANT BEHAVIOR WHEN LOOKING AT INSTANCES OF BATTERING AND BATTERING RELATIONSHIPS.THE RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT WHEN YOU HAVE STALKING BEHAVIOR, THE RISK RATIO GOES UP PHENOMENALLY, AND ON TOP OF THAT, THAT POPULATION OF BATTERERS WE HAVE GOES DOWN GEOMETRICALLY.LASTLY, GOING TO --

#MR. GORDON: ,"SORRY. WELL, MY OFFICE IS CLOSE TO LISA KAHN. SO MAYBE IT'S KIND OF RUBBING OFF. SORRY.THEN GO TO -- WELL, YOU THEN GO TO THE DIETZ THREATS SCALE. AND THE DIETZ THREATS SCALE IS SOMETHING THAT LOOKS AT ACTUAL RISK AND LOOKS AT RISK FACTORS. AND IN THE DIETZ SCALE, THERE ARE SEVERAL PREDICTORS OF VIOLENCE.AND WHAT IT SAYS IS, IF A DEFENDANT OR A POTENTIAL BATTERER HAS ANY ONE, ANY ONE OF THE FACTORS IN THAT DIETZ SCALE, THEY ARE 50 PERCENT MORE LIKELY TO COMMIT -- I THINK HE USES THE TERM AN ""ATROCIOUS CRIME"" SUCH AS A HOMICIDE.IN THIS CASE, THERE ARE FOUR ON THAT PRIMARY. SO IF WE WERE GOING TO USE THE PROPER NUMERIC ANALYSIS, WHAT WE WOULD FIND IS THAT THE POPULATION THAT WE GOT DOWN TO WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE FACTS THAT WE HAVE HERE COMPARED TO THE NUMBER OF HOMICIDES IS A MUCH SMALLER PORTION OF BATTERERS.AND NOT ONLY IS THE NUMBERS GAME MUCH, MUCH CLOSER AND SHOW A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP, BUT THAT IN FACT, WHEN LOOKING AT THE -- WHAT WE HAD OCCUR IN THIS CASE, THAT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON WAS AT VERY, VERY HIGH RISK AT ALL TIMES.AND AGAIN, I DON'T PROPOSE TO USE THAT ANALYSIS AND THAT'S NOT TESTIMONY I EXPECT TO BE PRESENTED IN TRIAL AND THAT IS NOT WHAT I'M SUGGESTING THE EXPERT WOULD TESTIFY TO AT TRIAL IN THE FORM OF ANALYSIS. I JUST WANT TO RESPOND TO THE SOCIAL SCIENCE ARGUMENT HERE, AND I THINK THERE'S INFORMATION THAT THE COURT NEEDS TO HAVE TO EVALUATE MANY OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED IN ANALYZING THIS TESTIMONY.ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAVE IN INTERCHANGE BETWEEN MR. GOLDBERG AND THE COURT WITH REGARD TO OUR ANALYSIS OF THESE INCIDENTS IS THAT WHAT WE PROPOSE TO TALK ABOUT WITHIN THAT POWER AND CONTROL WHEEL, THAT ANALYSIS OF POWER AND CONTROL WE THINK IS AN ARGUMENT THAT CERTAINLY CAN BE MADE WITH LOGIC AND COMMON SENSE.THAT WHEN ONE VIEWS THESE VARIOUS ACTS WITHIN A RUBRIC OF POWER AND CONTROL, THAT ONE BY COMMON SENSE CAN SEE THAT THEY ARE ALL CONTROL MECHANISMS, THAT THAT'S THE LOGICAL INFERENCE.ONE CAN SEE HOW THESE DIFFERENT TYPES OF BEHAVIORS WHEN LINED UP WITHIN A POWER AND CONTROL ANALYSIS CERTAINLY HAVE THAT -- THEY ARE MECHANISMS OF POWER AND CONTROL. AND WHEN VIEWING WHAT THE DEFENDANT DID IN THIS CASE, THAT THIS POWER AND CONTROL IN FACT ESCALATED.AND WITHOUT GETTING TO ANY EXPERT ANALYSIS AT ALL, JUST BY MAPPING WHAT OCCURRED HERE, BY LAYING IT OUT AND MAPPING IT AND LOOKING AT THE KEY EVENTS, THAT WE WOULD ARGUE TO THE JURY, BECAUSE THIS IS THE TRUTH OF WHAT HAPPENED, THAT THIS POWER AND CONTROL ESCALATED UNTIL THIS TERMINAL ACT OF CONTROL.NOW, I THINK CERTAINLY HAVING EXPERT TESTIMONY TO EXPLAIN THAT IN MUCH MORE ARTICULATE TERMS THAN I CAN AND WITH A BETTER -- CERTAINLY A BETTER FOUNDATION CERTAINLY, CERTAINLY HELPS, IS GOING TO HELP THE TRIER OF FACT. AND I THINK THERE ARE WAYS THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN THEORIES THAT THAT CAN COME IN.AND I DON'T KNOW IF THE WANTS ME TO BREAK NOW OR KEEP GOING.

#MR. GORDON: ,"OKAY. I'LL KEEP GOING.THE FIRST IS, UNDER THE TRADITIONAL BLEDSOE, BOWKER AND ARIS CASE. AND WHAT THOSE THREE CASES, BLEDSOE DEALING WITH RAPE TRAUMA SYNDROME, BOWKER DEALING WITH CHILD ABUSE ACCOMMODATION SYNDROME, ARIS DEALING WITH BATTERED WOMAN'S SYNDROME, TALK ABOUT THE ABILITY OF THE PROSECUTION -- ARIS WAS ACTUALLY THE DEFENSE INTRODUCING THE CASE -- BUT THE ABILITY TO INTRODUCE EVIDENCE TO DISABUSE THE TRIER OF FACT OF MISCONCEPTIONS THAT ARE HELD ABOUT THE ISSUE AT BAR.ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAVE THAT THE COURT RAISED WAS DISCUSSING 1107. I WILL GET TO 1107 IN A MINUTE. BUT THAT A NOTION THAT 1107 -- THIS WAS AN ARGUMENT ADVANCED BY THE DEFENSE -- THE PRESCRIPTION IN 1107(A) SOMEHOW TOOK OVER ALL EXPERT TESTIMONY ANALYSIS WITH REGARD TO ANY ISSUE WITH REGARD TO BATTERED WOMAN SYNDROME.I WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT IN A COUPLE WAYS.FIRST IS LEGISLATIVE INTENT. AND THE COURT HAS TO LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED WITH THIS SECTION AS IT WAS WRITTEN.THIS SECTION WAS WRITTEN BY THE SAME -- BY A LEGISLATURE WHICH HAS FINALLY BEGAN TO RESPOND TO THE NEEDS AND ISSUES OF BATTERED WOMEN. THIS IS LEGISLATURE THAT WITHIN THE FAMILY CODE HAS THE FAMILY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PREVENTION ACT.PASSED 273.6 PENAL CODE REGARDING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER, HELPED EXPAND, BROADEN 273.5, DOMESTIC ASSAULT LEGISLATION. AND IN THE SAME YEAR, THEY BROADENED 1107, PASSED MODIFICATIONS TO 12022 REGARDING SEIZING WEAPONS AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CODE AND JUST LAST YEAR PASSED BATTERED WOMAN'S ACT WHICH PROVIDED ALMOST 30 MILLION DOLLARS -- I THINK IT WAS 28 MILLION DOLLARS SPECIFICALLY FOR PROVIDING FOR THE PROSECUTION AND PROTECTION OF BATTERED WOMEN.THAT'S A PUBLIC POLICY VOICED BY THIS LEGISLATURE. THESE ARE SOME OF THE SECTIONS PASSED BY THIS LEGISLATURE.AND WHAT HAPPENED IN 1107 IS, 1107 AROSE AT A TIME WHEN COURTS WERE NOT ALLOWING EVIDENCE IN IN CASES WHERE A WOMAN HAD KILLED HER BATTERER AND COURTS WERE NOT ALLOWING IN CERTAIN EVIDENCE.SUFAT (PHONETIC) WAS ONE, CASE THAT OCCURRED -- CULVER CITY CASE ACTUALLY.1107 CAME AS A RESPONSE. AND WHEN 1107 FIRST CAME IN IN THE LANGUAGE WE SEE IT, OPPOSITION AROSE FROM BATTERED WOMEN'S GROUPS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA BY PROSECUTORS, BY WOMEN'S GROUPS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA SAYING, ""HOLD ON. WE UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE DOING IN THE INTEREST OF BATTERED WOMEN,"" WHICH THAT IS BY FAR, THE PURPOSE OF THAT SECTION IS TO ASSIST BATTERED WOMEN. ""WE UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE DOING, BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HURT US BECAUSE IF YOU PASS THE SECTION, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COME UP AND MAKE ARGUMENTS JUST LIKE THE ONES THE DEFENSE ARE MAKING HERE. AND WE DON'T WANT TO SEE A SECTION WHICH PRESCRIBES US THAT WAY AND LIMITS US. DON'T LIMIT US. IF ANYTHING, EXPAND IT.""AND THE AUTHOR ASSEMBLYMAN EAVES RESPONDED TO THAT AND AMENDMENTS WERE DRAWN UP AND MADE TO 1107 TO SPECIFICALLY INDICATE WHAT THE PRESCRIPTION WAS IN 1107.AND SPECIFICALLY IN THE ANALYSIS OF THAT BILL, AB785 THAT WAS DONE IN THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE -- AND I THINK I GAVE THE COURT SPECIFIC QUOTES OF THAT IN MY RESPONSE BRIEF -- IN THAT AREA WHICH DEALT WITH PRESCRIPTION, THE COURT -- THE LEGISLATURE SPECIFICALLY, SPECIFICALLY DEALT WITH BLEDSOE AND BOWKER AND SAID, ""THE SAME PRESCRIPTION THAT WE HAVE HERE IN BLEDSOE AND BOWKER IS THE SAME PRESCRIPTION THAT WE WANT TO HAVE IN 1107.""WE DON'T INTEND TO BLOCK ANY OTHER CASE LAW, ANY OTHER THEORIES OF ADMISSIBILITY. WE DON'T INTEND TO BLOCK ANY OTHER CASE LAW. WE WANT TO MIRROR THIS.AND IN FACT, IN 1992, AFTER THIS ACTION WAS PASSED WITH THAT INTENT AND LANGUAGE, IT WAS BROADENED EVEN FURTHER TO ALLOW NOT ONLY BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME EVIDENCE, BUT ALSO SPECIFICALLY THE IMPRESSIONS, NATURE, SENSIBILITIES OF THE VICTIM OF BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME.SO THERE IS -- BY NO MEANS, THIS WAS NOT EXCLUSIONARY STATUTE. BY NO MEANS WAS THIS STATUTE MEANT TO BLOCK OTHER EXISTING CASE LAW OR OTHER THEORIES.AND WHAT IS INTERESTING -- IS ACTUALLY VERY INTERESTING AND A PARADOX WITHIN BLEDSOE -- AND BLEDSOE AND BOWKER -- WHEN YOU READ ARIS, WHICH TALKS ABOUT BLEDSOE AND BOWKER AND HOW THOSE CASES RELATE TO THIS SYNDROME, WHAT IT SAYS IS, YOU KNOW, THE ONLY REASON THAT THE RAPE TRAUMA SYNDROME AND CHILD ABUSE ACCOMMODATION SYNDROME ARE NOT ALLOWED FOR THE PURPOSES THAT WE ARE PRESCRIBING -- AND THAT PURPOSE IS A VERY DISCREET ONE.THAT PURPOSE IS THAT FOR ME TO CALL AN EXPERT IN A CHILD ABUSE CASE AND SAY, ""DR. SO AND SO, HAVE YOU EXAMINED THE VICTIM IN THIS CASE; AND AFTER HAVING DONE SO, DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION AS TO WHETHER SHE WAS ABUSED OR NOT?"" THAT I CAN NOT DO. ABSOLUTELY. AND DON'T IN THOSE CASES AND WOULDN'T IN THIS CASE.WHAT I CAN DO, WHAT I ABSOLUTELY CAN DO IS TO BRING IN CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING WHAT OCCURS AND WHAT HAS OCCURRED IN THIS CHILD'S LIFE, KIND OF EVIDENCE LIKE ACTING OUT IN SCHOOL, HER SCHOOL RECORDS, HOW -- CHANGES IN HER RELATIONSHIP, CHANGES IN HER BEHAVIOR, EXTERNAL EVIDENCE BY WHATEVER PURPOSE I CAN BRING IT IN, AND THEN HAVE AN EXPERT TALK ABOUT VICTIMS OF THAT AGE AND CLASS WITHOUT REFERRING TO THE VICTIM HERE AT ALL.IN OTHER WORDS, SAY TO THAT EXPERT, ""HAVE YOU DONE RESEARCH WITH REGARDS TO EFFECTS OF THE SEXUAL ABUSE ON EIGHT YEAR OLDS?"" ""YES, I HAVE."" ""WHAT KIND OF BEHAVIORS OCCUR? WHAT HAPPENS?"" HAVE THEM SAY WHATEVER THEY SAY.AND THEN IN CLOSING, IF I CAN MATCH IT UP, GREAT. I CAN MATCH IT UP. SAME WITH RAPE TRAUMA SYNDROME.AND THAT IS ESSENTIALLY KEY IN BOTH OF THOSE WHEN ANY MISCONCEPTIONS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP EITHER THROUGH CROSS-EXAMINATION, OPENING ARGUMENT, PRESENTATION OF EVIDENCE WITH REGARD TO ANY OF THOSE SYNDROMES.AND THE ONE THAT THE COURT HAS COMMONLY HEARD -- AND I KNOW THIS HAS OCCURRED IN FRONT OF THIS COURT BEFORE WITH RAPE CASES -- ""WHY DID YOU WAIT TO REPORT THIS TO THE POLICE? YOU HAD BEEN OUT WITH HIM BEFORE. SO THEREFORE, YOU CAN'T BE RAPED.""THE CHILD, ""WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER SAY ANYTHING TO ANYBODY?"" WELL, LOOK, THIS KID WAS HAVING TROUBLE IN SCHOOL. SO SHE MUST BE A BAD KID IN LYING. ALL THOSE KIND OF INFERENCES THERE THAT ARE RAISED.WHAT IS INTERESTING IN BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME, WHAT IS FASCINATING, IT'S KIND OF PROPHETIC HERE COMPARED TO THOSE CASES, IS THAT THE MISCONCEPTIONS THAT WE HEAR IN BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME CASES, THE MISCONCEPTIONS THAT ARE CONTAINED WITHIN THE MOVING PAPERS BY DEFENSE THAT WERE ARGUED IN FRONT OF THIS COURT YESTERDAY, WERE LAID OUT AND ARGUED IN VERY SPECIFIC NUMBER AS THOSE MYTHS AROUND BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME IN 1979.

#MR. GORDON: ,"ONE CASE I JUST WANT TO TALK ABOUT WITH THE COURT BEFORE WE TALK TO DR. DUTTON IS A CASE THAT WE HAVE CITED IN OUR BRIEF CALLED PEOPLE VERSUS PHILLIPS AT 122 CAL.APP.3D 69.I JUST MENTION PHILLIPS FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS. ONE, I THINK IT IS THE USE THAT THE COURT USED EXPERT TESTIMONY FOR IN PHILLIPS WHICH WAS APPROVED OF IN SEVERAL SUPREME COURT CASES, INCLUDING STOLL. I THINK IS VERY ANALOGOUS TO A SITUATION WE MAY HAVE OCCUR IN THIS CASE.PHILLIPS WAS A CASE OF HOMICIDE IN WHICH THE DEFENDANT KILLED HER CHILDREN THROUGH A SYNDROME KNOWN AS MUNCHAUSEN BY PROXY SYNDROME AND IN THAT SYNDROME -- I'M SURE THE COURT IS AWARE OF IT -- THIS WAS A WOMAN THAT DESCRIBED TO THE WORLD, BY ALL PUBLIC ACCOUNTS, WAS THIS WELL-TO-DO MOTHER, EVERYTHING WAS FINE, SHE HAD THIS GRAND LIFE, TWO KIDS, THE STATION WAGON IN THE DRIVEWAY, EVERYTHING LOOKED WONDERFUL, AND YET THIS HORRID ACT OF HER KILLING HER KID -- HER KIDS THROUGH THIS SYNDROME OCCURRED.THE PROSECUTION ASKED THE COURT TO USE EXPERT TESTIMONY, NOT TO DIAGNOSE THIS WOMAN, NOT TO SAY THAT THEY HAD READ THE RECORD AND HAD LOOKED AT THE HISTORY HERE -- AND THIS WAS CLEARLY A MUNCHAUSEN BY PROXY CASE -- NOT TO IN ANY WAY EXAMINE THE RECORD, BUT TO GET UP AND JUST DESCRIBE WHAT OCCURRED WITHIN THAT SYNDROME IN GENERAL, TO EXPLAIN IT TO THE JURY SO THAT THEY COULD UNDERSTAND, IF PROVEN, IF THE FACTS UNDERNEATH PROVEN, SHOW A MOTIVE, THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT DOES EXIST AND IT IN FACT PROVIDES A MOTIVE.AND IN FACT THERE IS A QUOTE THAT WITHIN PHILLIPS THAT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT AND IT APPEARS AROUND PAGE 77 TO 80, WHERE IN THAT PASSAGE AT 77 TO 80 THE PHILLIPS COURT SPECIFICALLY LAYS OUT A PROCEDURE FOR -- FOR PRESENTATION OF THIS KIND OF TESTIMONY, INCLUDING HOW THE QUESTION SHOULD BE FRAMED, WHAT ISSUES CAN IT GO TO AND A JURY INSTRUCTION, 2.72 THAT SHOULD BE READ WITH THE TESTIMONY AS IT -- RIGHT AFTER IT COMES IN IN AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION, AND THERE THE COURT SAID:""WHILE PROSECUTOR ORDINARILY NEED NOT PROVE MOTIVE AS AN ELEMENT OF A CRIME, THE ABSENCE OF APPARENT MOTIVE MAY MAKE PROOF OF THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS LESS PERSUASIVE. CLEARLY THAT WAS THE PRINCIPLE PROBLEM CONFRONTING THE PROSECUTOR HERE. IN THE ABSENCE OF A MOTIVATIONAL HYPOTHESIS AND IN LIGHT OF OTHER INFORMATION WHICH THE JURY HAD CONCERNING HER PERSONALITY AND CHARACTER, THE CONDUCT OF THE APPELLANT WAS APPARENTLY INEXPLICABLE, AS BOTH PARTIES RECOGNIZED THE EXPERT'S TESTIMONY WAS DESIGNED TO FILL THIS GAP.""SO PHILLIPS IS A PRIME EXAMPLE OF OUTSIDE OF ONE OF THESE USES WHERE EXPERT TESTIMONY WAS USED IN A CASE IN CHIEF TO EXPLAIN A MOTIVE, NOT TO DIAGNOSE THE VICTIM, NOT TO DIAGNOSE THE DEFENDANT, NOT TO ANALYZE EVIDENCE, BUT TO PRESENT INFORMATION TO THE TRIER OF FACTS SO THAT IT CAN BE UNDERSTOOD.AND IN DAY, A CASE THAT SPECIFICALLY TALKS ABOUT A WOMAN'S ISSUES, THERE IS -- DAY HAS A VERY, VERY IMPORTANT QUOTE WHICH THE COURT SHOULD CONSIDER WITH REGARD TO 352 TYPE OF INFORMATION OR ANALYSIS FOR THIS TESTIMONY.AND IN DAY, WHICH WAS TESTIMONY REGARDING THE KIND OF ISSUES WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE, WHERE THERE WAS A 352 OBJECTION TO THE EXPERT TESTIMONY, THE DAY COURT SAID, LOOK, THIS ISN'T ANY KIND OF MAGIC THAT IS BEING PLACED IN FRONT OF SOME GULLIBLE GROUP OF PEOPLE; THIS IS REASONABLE INFORMATION BEING PLACED IN FRONT OF A REASONABLE TRIER OF FACT AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY PROPER.AND NOT ONLY IS THAT SUPPORTED BY THE LAW, THERE ARE SEVERAL STUDIES WHICH WE HAVE CITED IN OUR BRIEF, LAW REVIEW ARTICLES AND STUDIES WHICH HAVE IN FACT -- AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES THE COURT GETS THIS KIND OF INFORMATION-- HAS IN FACT MEASURED THE IMPACT OF EXPERT WITNESS TESTIMONY ON THE TRIAL PROCESS AND JURIES WITH REGARD TO BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME.THOSE ARE CITED IN OUR BRIEF, AND AS THE COURT SAW ON THE BRIEF, WHAT WAS INDICATED IS THAT THERE WAS NO SUCH PREJUDICIAL IMPACT AS DESCRIBED BY MR. UELMEN YESTERDAY AT ALL.IN FACT, WHAT THE STUDIES FOUND AND WHAT THE COURTS FOUND IN DAY AND ARIS AND IN THE OTHER CASES, IS THAT, AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE, TO MAKE A DECISION WITHOUT THIS COULD CONSTITUTE GRAVE INJUSTICE.WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO CALL DR. DUTTON IF I COULD, SIR.

"['DUTTON,']","THIS IS SOMETHING CALLED THE ""CONFLICTS TACTICS"" SCALE, A SCALE THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY DR. MURRAY STRAUSS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE. THIS IS A SCALE THAT HAS BEEN USED IN ALL OF THE U.S. NATIONAL SURVEYS OF INCIDENTS OF SPOUSAL ASSAULT.HE DID A NATIONAL SURVEY IN 1975, HE DID ANOTHER ONE IN 1985, HE DID A THIRD ONE IN 1992.NOW, TO BE CONSIDERED ASSAULTIVE, ALL THAT HAS TO HAPPEN, AND I'M NOT TRYING TO MINIMIZE THIS, IS THAT A MAN HAS TO OR -- THE SURVEYS ARE DONE BOTH WITH PERPETRATORS AND VICTIMS.THE RESULTS MAY BE SURPRISINGLY ABOUT THE SAME. THERE IS NOT A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN INCIDENCE RATE WHETHER YOU ASKED THE QUESTION ""DID YOU DO THIS"" OR WHETHER YOU ASK THE QUESTION ""WAS THIS EVER DONE TO YOU,"" BUT IF SOMEONE ANSWERS ""YES"" TO ANY ONE OF THESE QUESTIONS: ""PUSHED, GRABBED OR SHOVED THE OTHER ONE, SLAPPED ANOTHER ONE, KICKED, BIT OR HIT THE OTHER ONE, HIT OR TRIED TO HIT WITH SOMETHING, BEAT UP, THREATENED WITH A KNIFE OR GUN OR USED A KNIFE OR GUN,"" THEY JUST HAVE TO ANSWER YES TO ANY ONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS TO GO INTO THIS GENERAL POOL OF MEN WHO ARE CONSIDERED TO BE ASSAULTIVE.

"['DUTTON,']","UMM, WELL, IT IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT IS A RATHER LIBERAL CRITERION, I THINK, GIVEN THE KIND OF EVIDENCE THAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT IN THIS CASE.AS THE NUMBER OF ACTS BECOMES MORE SERIOUS AND MORE FREQUENT, THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU GET INTO A DIFFERENT KIND OF PSYCHOLOGY OF THE PERSON WHO WAS COMMITTING THOSE ACTS. I MEAN, JUST TO GIVE A CASE IN POINT, IF A MAN ONCE IN HIS MARRIAGE, IN REACTION TO SITUATIONAL STRESSES, HAPPENS TO PUSH HIS WIFE, HE STILL QUALIFIES FOR THIS LARGE POOL OF MEN WHO ARE CONSIDERED TO BE BATTERERS, BUT I WOULD SAY AS A PSYCHOLOGIST THAT IS A VERY DIFFERENT MAN THAN SOMEONE WHO IS USING THESE MORE SERIOUS TYPES OF PHYSICAL ASSAULTS AND IS USING THEM REPEATEDLY.AND WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO THE MEN USING THE ""BEAT UP"" AND THE MORE SERIOUS TYPES OF ASSAULT REPEATEDLY, THEN YOU ARE DOWN TO TWO PERCENT OF THE U.S. POPULATION.

","JANUARY 12, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
"['DUTTON,']","DEFINITELY NOT. THIS JUST MEASURES PRIMARILY PHYSICAL ACTIONS. PROBABLY AS IMPORTANT A SCALE IS ONE THAT WAS ALLUDED TO IN COURT PREVIOUSLY. IT IS DEVELOPED BY DR. RICHARD TOLMAN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, SOMETIMES CALLED THE PSYCHOLOGICAL MALTREATMENT OF WOMEN INVENTORY, BUT WE WILL CALL IT THE TOLMAN SCALE, AFTER THE FOUNDER.THIS SCALE MEASURES A VARIETY OF EMOTIONAL ABUSE ITEMS, PUT DOWN BY PHYSICAL APPEARANCE, INSULTED ME OR SHAMED ME, CALLED ME NAMES, SWORE AT ME. THIS IS ONE CATEGORY OF THE TOLMAN SCALE THAT DEALS SPECIFICALLY WITH EMOTIONAL ABUSE, THAT IS ATTEMPTS TO UNDERMINE THE SELF-ESTEEM OF THE OTHER PERSON.

","JANUARY 12, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.

","AND IN YOUR OPINION, IN TRYING TO FIND A LINK BETWEEN THE HOMICIDE AND THE BATTERING POPULATION, IS IT PROPER TO LOOK AT THIS BROADER 2.5 MILLION SUBSET OR SET?

"['DUTTON,']","NO, NOT REALLY. I MEAN, YOU ARE COMPARING, IN MY OPINION, FENDER-BENDERS WITH HEAD-ON COLLISIONS IF YOU DO IT THAT WAY.
","JANUARY 12, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.

","AND IN YOUR OPINION, IF YOU HAVE THE MULTIPLE TYPES OF ABUSE WITHIN A HISTORY, WITHIN A PERSONALITY, THAT POPULATION, THERE IS A LINK BETWEEN THAT AND SPOUSAL HOMICIDES?
","JANUARY 12, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
"['DUTTON,']","THERE IS A PSYCHOLOGICAL LINK. THERE HAS -- IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT EMPIRICALLY, YOU ARE LOOKING AT A WHOLE SEPARATE SET OF STUDIES AND THOSE ARE SOME OF THE STUDIES WHICH ARE ALLUDED TO IN COURT THE OTHER DAY, WHICH ARE STUDIES THAT ARE DONE ON WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN KILLED BY INTIMATE PARTNERS AND WHERE THE RESEARCHERS HAVE TAKEN THE TIME TO INVESTIGATE THAT STUDY. THAT IS, THEY START WITH THE CORONER'S REPORT, WORKED BACK TO THE POLICE REPORT, AND IN SOME CASES GONE BACK AND INTERVIEWED THE FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF THE VICTIM TO FIND OUT AS MUCH AS THEY COULD ABOUT WHAT THE BACKGROUND FACTORS WERE IN THOSE RELATIONSHIPS.
","JANUARY 12, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.

","NOW, WHEN YOU LOOK AT ONE OF THESE HISTORIES, IS IT SIGNIFICANT TO YOU TO LOOK AT INCIDENTS THAT OCCURRED WITHIN THE PAST YEAR?

","WHY?
","JANUARY 12, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
"['DUTTON,']","UMM, BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT SOUND LIKE SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED TEN YEARS IN THE PAST IS HISTORY AND UNRELATED, IN FACT WHAT FREQUENTLY GOES ON IN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS IS VERY DIFFERENT.LET ME JUST GIVE YOU A QUICK EXAMPLE IF I MIGHT. I HAD A MALE CLIENT WHO BEAT UP HIS WIFE IN 1985. WHEN HE BEAT HER UP HE SAID, ""NEXT TIME IT IS GOING TO BE WORSE"" AND SHE REPORTED TO ME THAT WHEN HE BEAT HER UP HIS FACE CHANGED, HIS PHYSIOGNOMY CHANGED, HIS NOSTRILS FLARED, HE HAD A VERY DIFFERENT EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE.FOR THE NEXT SIX YEARS HE NEVER HIT HER AGAIN, BUT WHENEVER SHE SAW THAT EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE, SHE IMMEDIATELY TOWED THE LINE, SO THERE WAS A CONTINUING CONTROL THAT WENT ON EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS A SEVEN-YEAR GAP BETWEEN THAT 1985 INCIDENCE OF PHYSICAL ABUSE AND THE NEXT INCIDENCE OF PHYSICAL ABUSE.
","JANUARY 12, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
"MR. GORDON:
","WAS IT SIGNIFICANT TO YOU TO CONSIDER BOTH OF THOSE ACTS?
","JANUARY 12, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
"['DUTTON,']","THEY HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED IN CONJUNCTION. IF THE TWO -- IF THE INTERACTION OF THE CONTROL DOMINATION EMOTIONAL ABUSE IS NOT CONSIDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PHYSICAL ABUSE, YOU LOSE THE CONTEXT OF THE PHYSICAL ABUSE, YOU LOSE THE MEANING AND MOTIVATION OF PHYSICAL ABUSE.
","JANUARY 12, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
"MR. GORDON:
","IN REGARD TO THE STUDIES OF SPOUSAL HOMICIDE, IS THERE ANY ONE MOTIVE THAT HAS COME OUT AS PREDOMINANT?
","JANUARY 12, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
"['DUTTON,']","WELL, THE MAIN PRECIPITATING FACTOR -- IN FACT, THERE IS SIX DIFFERENT STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE. THE FIRST ONE WAS MARTIN WOLFGANG, DID A STUDY IN PHILADELPHIA, WHICH IS STILL A CLASSIC IN 1948, BUT THE TWO MAIN THINGS THAT COME OUT IS, FIRST OF ALL, ESTRANGEMENT, JEALOUSY, A HISTORY OF PHYSICAL ABUSE AND/OR JEALOUSY IN THE RELATIONSHIP AND RECENT ESTRANGEMENT BETWEEN THE PERPETRATOR AND VICTIM.
","JANUARY 12, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
"MR. GORDON:
","WHEN YOU SAY ""ESTRANGEMENT,"" DOES THAT MEAN DIVORCE?
","JANUARY 12, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
"['DUTTON,']","IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN DIVORCE. ""ESTRANGEMENT"" IS REALLY SORT OF A SUBJECTIVE TERM. IT MEANS THAT THE PERPETRATOR IN HIS MIND -- AND I'M TALKING HERE ABOUT WOMEN BEING KILLED BY MEN, SO I USE THE TERM ""HIS"" -- IN HIS MIND THE PERPETRATOR HAS SEEN THE RELATIONSHIP AS FINALLY LOST. THAT TOTALLY CHANGES HIS PSYCHOLOGY AT THAT POINT, SO IT GOES FROM CONTROL AND DENIGRATE TO DESTROY AND THERE IS CONSIDERABLE PSYCHIATRIC LITERATURE ON THAT AND SOME OF THIS LITERATURE WE HAVE USED IN OUR OWN RESEARCH.
","JANUARY 12, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
"MR. GORDON:
","SO THE MERE FACT THAT THERE IS A DIVORCE MIGHT NOT TRIGGER THAT?
","JANUARY 12, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
"['DUTTON,']","NOT NECESSARILY IF THEY ARE DIVORCED, BUT THE MAN STILL IS HOLDING OUT SOME KIND OF HOPE THAT THEY MIGHT RECONCILE, THEN HE HAS STILL BONDED HER AND HE MIGHT NOT SUBJECTIVELY SEE THEM AS BEING ESTRANGED AT THIS POINT.
","JANUARY 12, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
"MR. GORDON:
","SO HE MIGHT GO ON WITH THIS CONTROL NOTION UNTIL SOME OTHER EVENT TRIGGERS THIS EVENT?
","JANUARY 12, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
"['DUTTON,']","THAT IS --
","JANUARY 12, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
"MR. GORDON:
","WOULD IT HAVE TO BE SOME MAJOR EVENT, LIKE MOVING OUT OF STATE?
","JANUARY 12, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
"['DUTTON,']","IT WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE A MAJOR EVENT. IT COULD BE A MINOR EVENT, DEPENDING ON HOW THAT MAN CONSTRUES THE EVENTS AND WHAT ITS SYMBOLIC VALUE IS TO HIM.
","JANUARY 12, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
"MR. GORDON:
","WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

"['DUTTON,']","WELL, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENS WITH BATTERED WOMEN IS THAT IS SOMETHING CALLED TRAUMATIC BONDING WHICH IS A KIND OF PECULIAR PROCESS, BUT BASICALLY IT WORKS LIKE THIS:WE GET ATTACHED TO PEOPLE WHO INTERMITTENTLY TREAT US WELL, BADLY, WELL, BADLY, WHERE THERE IS POSITIVE-NEGATIVE REPEATED BEHAVIOR.ONE OF THE EFFECTS OF TRAUMATIC BONDING IS THAT WITH TIME AWAY FROM THE ABUSER A WOMAN FORGETS THE NEGATIVE STUFF AND REMEMBERS WHAT WAS GOOD ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP. I HAVE SEEN IT HAPPEN WITHIN A WEEK, BUT IT CAN CERTAINLY TAKE A LONGER TIME PERIOD.

#THE COURT: ,"THANK YOU.MR. UELMEN, DO YOU WISH TO RESPOND?
","JANUARY 12, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
#MR. UELMEN: ,"YES, YOUR HONOR.LET ME LEAD OFF BY ASSURING THE COURT THAT WE ARE NOT WITHDRAWING THE ARGUMENT MADE IN OUR BRIEF THAT THE ADMISSION OF THIS EVIDENCE WOULD ALSO BE A VIOLATION OF THE DEFENDANT'S DUE PROCESS RIGHTS UNDER BOTH THE FEDERAL AND STATE CONSTITUTIONS.AND WE CITE A CASE WHICH I THINK IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT ONE, THE CASE OF MC KINNEY VERSUS REESE, IN WHICH THE 9TH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS RECENTLY GRANTED A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS TO A CALIFORNIA DEFENDANT WHO HAD BEEN CONVICTED ON THE BASIS OF THE ADMISSION OF EVIDENCE OF PRIOR ACTS; AND THE COURT HELD THAT WAS A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL DUE PROCESS RIGHTS THAT REQUIRED THE GRANT OF A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS.SO THIS IS NOT A GROUNDS THAT WE ARE WITHDRAWING FROM CONSIDERATION OF THE COURT.LET ME BACK UP TO THE BEGINNING, THE THEORY THAT THERE IS A SPECIAL EXCEPTION FOR RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASES THAT ALLOWS THE COURT TO ADMIT EVIDENCE OF PRIOR ACTS OF MISCONDUCT WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE EXCEPTIONS CONTAINED IN SECTION 1101(B).TO SUPPORT THAT ARGUMENT, WE HEARD FROM THE PROSECUTION A NUMBER OF ARGUMENTS.FIRST OF ALL, WE HEARD THAT THIS IS SIMPLE COMMON SENSE, THAT WHEN SOMEONE KILLS SOMEONE WITH WHOM THEY ARE IN A RELATIONSHIP, THE FIRST QUESTION THAT SHOULD OCCUR TO US IS WHAT WAS GOING ON, AND ONLY WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE RELATIONSHIP DOES THE KILLING MAKE SENSE.THERE'S ALSO ONE PROBLEM WITH THAT; AND THAT IS, THESE QUESTIONS ARISE ONLY WHEN YOU ASSUME THAT THE DEFENDANT IS THE PERSON WHO DID THE KILLING. IT'S A KIND OF A WORKING BACKWARDS KIND OF ARGUMENT. WE'RE ASSUMING THAT THE PERPETRATOR OF THIS KILLING WAS A PERSON IN RELATIONSHIP WITH THE VICTIM.SO LET'S GO BACK AND TAKE APART THAT RELATIONSHIP AND LOOK AT EVERY ASPECT OF IT.BUT THAT COMMON SENSE DOESN'T HELP US VERY MUCH OR GET US VERY FAR IF WE'RE DEALING WITH A CASE WHERE THE ISSUE TO BE LITIGATED IS, WHO DID THIS KILLING. WE'RE NOT ASSUMING THAT IT WAS ANYONE IN RELATIONSHIP WITH THE VICTIM.AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT MANY, MANY OF THE CASES THAT HAVE BEEN CITED BY THE PROSECUTION THROUGHOUT THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE CASES WHERE THE IDENTITY OF THE KILLER WAS NOT REALLY AN ISSUE. WHAT WAS REALLY BEING LITIGATED WAS, WAS THAT A SELF-DEFENSE SITUATION, WAS THE KILLER ACTING IN THE HEAT OF PASSION, WAS THIS AN ACCIDENT, DID THE GUN ACCIDENTALLY GO OFF, WAS THERE DEMENTED CAPACITY, SOME FORM OF ABUSE EXCUSE?AND I WANT TO ASSURE THE COURT AT THE OUTSET HERE AND NOW, AND ALL OF THE DEFENSE LAWYERS AGREE IN THIS STATEMENT, THIS IS A MURDER CASE PERIOD. THE DEFENSE IS NOT GOING TO PRESENT ANY DEFENSE WITH RESPECT TO HEAT OF PASSION.THE DEFENDANT WILL NOT BE SEEKING AN INSTRUCTION ON VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER. WE WANT THIS CASE SUBMITTED TO THE JURY AS A MURDER CASE; AND THEY WILL HAVE TO COME BACK WITH A VERDICT OF GUILTY OF MURDER OR NOT GUILTY OF MURDER, MR. O.J. SIMPSON.SO THE ONLY ISSUE REALLY THAT IS GOING TO BE IN CONTENTION IN THIS TRIAL IS WHETHER MR. O.J. SIMPSON IS THE PERSON WHO PERPETRATED THIS HOMICIDE. AND I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT ALL OF THIS EVIDENCE OF PRIOR CHARACTER OF THE CHARACTER OF MR. SIMPSON BE LOOKED FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT IS REALLY GOING TO BE IN CONTENTION IN THE COURSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS.NOW, TO SUPPORT THIS THEORY OF A RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE EXCEPTION, THE PROSECUTION HAS TOLD US, ""WELL, ZACK ISN'T THE ONLY CASE THAT HAS EVER SAID THIS. WE'VE PRESENTED 10 CASES IN WHICH COURTS HAVE MADE STATEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO EVIDENCE COMING IN TO SHOW THE NATURE OF A RELATIONSHIP IN A RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASE.""WELL, I LOOKED AT THOSE 10 CASES. I CERTAINLY LOOKED AT THEM MUCH MORE CAREFULLY THAN I HAD BEFORE THE ARGUMENT WAS PRESENTED HERE IN COURT AND DISCOVERED THAT SEVEN OF THE 10 CASES PRECEDED THE ENACTMENT OF THE CALIFORNIA EVIDENCE CODE.AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT BECAUSE OF COURSE, OUR CONTENTION IS THAT THIS SO-CALLED EXCEPTION FOR RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASES IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND IN THE CALIFORNIA EVIDENCE CODE WHICH DEFINES FOR THIS CASE WHAT EVIDENCE WILL BE ADMITTED AND WON'T BE ADMITTED. ONLY THREE OF THE 10 CASES WERE ACTUALLY DECIDED UNDER THE CALIFORNIA EVIDENCE CODE AND CONSTRUED THE PROVISIONS OF 1101(A) AND 1101(B), AND THOSE ARE THE THREE CASES THAT ARE CITED ON PAGE 32 OF THE PEOPLE'S RESPONSE TO THE MOTION IN LIMINE.ALL THREE OF THESE CASES INCIDENTALLY HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO IN THE COURSE OF THE ORAL ARGUMENT PRESENTED BY THE PEOPLE, AND I THINK IT'S INTERESTING TO TAKE A LOOK AT THESE CASES AND SEE WHAT WAS REALLY AT ISSUE, WHAT WAS BEING CONTENDED IN THE TRIALS AND HOW MUCH SIMILARITY WAS THERE BETWEEN THE PRIOR ACTS THAT WERE BEING ADMITTED OSTENSIBLY TO EXPLAIN THIS RELATIONSHIP AND THE ACTUAL OFFENSE FOR WHICH THE DEFENDANT WAS ON TRIAL.THE FIRST OF THESE CASES IS PEOPLE VERSUS HELFEND, A 1969 CASE, IN WHICH THE DEFENDANT WAS ACCUSED OF MURDERING HIS FORMER WIFE'S HUSBAND. THE DEFENDANT WAS ARRESTED WHILE DRIVING AN AUTOMOBILE ACROSS THE MEXICAN BORDER IN WHICH THE BODY OF THE VICTIM, HIS FORMER WIFE'S HUSBAND, WAS IN THE TRUNK OF THE AUTOMOBILE, NOT A CASE IN WHICH THE IDENTITY OF THE KILLER WAS BEING CLOSELY CONTESTED.IN FACT, THE DEFENSE THAT HE PRESENTED IN THAT CASE WAS SELF-DEFENSE, THAT HE HAD KILLED THIS MAN IN SELF-DEFENSE. AND IT WAS IN THAT CONTEXT THAT THE COURT ADMITTED EVIDENCE THAT ON A PRIOR OCCASION, HE HAD HIRED SOMEONE OR ATTEMPTED TO HIRE SOMEONE TO BEAT UP THIS SAME VICTIM AND HE HAD ALSO BURNED DOWN THIS VICTIM'S HOUSE.NOW, THAT'S A VERY DIFFERENT PROCESS OF EVIDENTIARY INFERENCE THAN THE COURT IS BEING ASKED TO ENGAGE IN THIS CASE. WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT EXPLAINING A RELATIONSHIP. WE ARE PRESENTING VERY SIMILAR ACTS THAT GO DIRECTLY TO COUNTERING THE DEFENDANT'S CLAIM THAT THE MURDER WAS A SELF-DEFENSE KILLING.THE SECOND CASE IS PEOPLE VERSUS DANIELS. THIS IS THE CASE IN WHICH THE DEFENDANT WAS ACCUSED OF KILLING HIS WIFE BY EXPLODING A CAN BOMB IN THE AUTOMOBILE IN WHICH SHE WAS SEATED.AND THE PRIOR MISCONDUCT THAT WAS ADMITTED OSTENSIBLY TO EXPLAIN THEIR RELATIONSHIP WAS THAT WITHIN THE ONE YEAR PRIOR TO THE CAR BOMB GOING OFF, HE HAD ATTEMPTED TO ASSAULT HER WITH A KNIFE, HE HAD HELD A GUN TO HER HEAD AND HE HAD DRIVEN A CAR OFF A CLIFF AND JUMPED OUT OF THE CAR SO THAT SHE WOULD GO OVER THE CLIFF IN THE CAR. AND FORTUNATELY, THE CAR RAN INTO A TREE, FORTUNATELY FOR HER. IT DELAYED HER DEATH BY ABOUT SIX MONTHS.NOW, THAT'S NOT EVIDENCE TO SIMPLY EXPLAIN A RELATIONSHIP. THAT IS STRONG EVIDENCE OF A PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR SHOWING THAT HIS GOAL WAS TO KILL HIS WIFE AND HE HAD FAILED ON THREE PRIOR ATTEMPTS BEFORE HE FINALLY SUCCEEDED.THE THIRD CASE IS PEOPLE VERSUS HAYLOCK INVOLVING A FEMALE DEFENDANT WHO WAS ACCUSED OF KILLING HER EX-BOYFRIEND. THE KILLING WAS COMMITTED IN AUGUST OF 1979 IN THE PRESENCE OF AN EYEWITNESS, THE EYEWITNESS BEING THE VICTIM'S MOTHER.AND SHE REPORTED THAT THE DEFENDANT ATTACKED THE VICTIM WITH A BUTCHER KNIFE SAYING, ""YOU SON OF A BITCH. THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED,"" AND THEN STABBED HIM WITH A BUTCHER KNIFE.WELL, THE PRIOR INCIDENTS THAT WERE ADMITTED TO EXPLAIN THIS RELATIONSHIP WERE THAT NINE MONTHS BEFORE, IN DECEMBER OF 1978, SHE ATTACKED THE VICTIM WITH A BUTCHER KNIFE, AND ON FEBRUARY OR IN FEBRUARY OF 1979, SIX MONTHS BEFORE THIS INCIDENT, SHE AGAIN ATTACKED HIM WITH A BUTCHER KNIFE.NOW, WHAT WE SEE IN THESE CASES ARE SIMPLY CLASSIC EXAMPLES OF THE KIND OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE PRIOR INCIDENTS AND THE INCIDENT ON TRIAL THAT IS GOING TO ASSIST THE JURY IN TERMS OF RESOLVING AN ISSUE BEING CONTENDED IN THESE CASES AS TO WHETHER IT WAS AN INTENTIONAL KILLING SHOWING THE IDENTITY OF THE KILLINGS BY SIGNATURE KIND OF FACTS, THE CLASSIC APPLICATION OF THE 1101(B) EXCEPTIONS.THESE ARE FAR FROM ANY EXAMPLE OF WHAT THE COURT OR WHAT THE PROSECUTION SAYS ZACK STANDS FOR; THAT WHENEVER YOU HAVE A RELATIONSHIP CASE, YOU CAN BRING IN EVERYTHING THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN THE RELATIONSHIP IN TERMS OF PRIOR ACTS OF MISCONDUCT.NOW, WITH RESPECT TO ZACK ITSELF, I KNOW THERE HAS BEEN SOME DISAGREEMENT ABOUT WHAT ZACK REALLY STANDS FOR, IF ANYTHING.ALL WE CAN SAY IS THAT IN OUR READING OF THE CASE AS SIMPLY AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE CALL THE THIRD EXCEPTION, THAT IS WHERE THE DEFENDANT TAKES THE STAND AND PRESENTS HIS RELATIONSHIP AS A POSITIVE LOVING ONE, THAT THE PEOPLE CAN COUNTER THAT WITH EVIDENCE JUST AS THEY CAN WITH ANY OTHER WITNESS TO SHOW THAT THIS ISN'T TRUE. AND THAT OF COURSE WOULD NOT ARISE UNLESS THAT WAS DONE IN THIS CASE IN TERMS OF EVIDENCE BEING PRESENTED BY THE DEFENDANT.ALL I CAN SAY IS, OUR READING OF ZACK PUTS US IN VERY GOOD COMPANY BECAUSE THAT IS PRECISELY HOW THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT READ ZACK.THE ONLY CASE THAT ANYONE CAN FIND IN WHICH THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS EVER CITED ZACK IS THE CASE OF PEOPLE VERSUS ALLISON. AND WE INVITE THE COURT'S ATTENTION TO THE FOOTNOTE IN ALLISON, WHERE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY SAY.ZACK STANDS FOR THE PROPOSITION THAT A DEFENDANT WHO TESTIFIES CAN BE IMPEACHED WITH EVIDENCE OF PRIOR INCIDENTS OF MISCONDUCT.AND FINALLY, THE PEOPLE RELY ON THE HASTON CASE AS REALLY AN EXAMPLE OF THIS RELATIONSHIP CONCEPT, THAT SOMEHOW HASTON REINFORCES THIS THEORY BECAUSE IN HASTON, THE PRIOR ACTS THAT WERE ADMITTED WERE ACTS COMMITTED WITH THE SAME CONFEDERATE, AND BECAUSE THE DEFENDANT HAD COMMITTED TWO PRIOR ROBBERIES WITH THE SAME CONFEDERATE, THE JURY COULD DRAW AN INFERENCE THAT SINCE HE WAS CHARGED IN THIS CASE WITH COMMITTING A ROBBERY WITH THE SAME CONFEDERATE, THAT THIS IS A PATTERN OF CONDUCT THAT ASSISTED IN IDENTIFYING HIM AS THE PERPETRATOR. SO THE SIGNATURE REALLY WAS THE PRESENCE OF THAT CONFEDERATE.THAT REALLY ISN'T A RELATIONSHIP CASE AT ALL. IN FACT, THAT CASE MIGHT BE OF SOME ASSISTANCE TO THE PROSECUTION IF THEY HAD EVIDENCE THAT ON TWO PRIOR OCCASIONS, MR. SIMPSON HAD ENCOUNTERED NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON WITH RONALD GOLDMAN, AND ON BOTH OF THOSE OCCASIONS, MR. SIMPSON REACTED IN SOME SORT OF VIOLENT WAY BY ASSAULTING HIS WIFE OR ASSAULTING MR. GOLDMAN.THEN WE MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF WHETHER THOSE INCIDENTS EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED ON THE NIGHT OF JUNE 12TH, 1994 WHEN THE PROSECUTION IS GOING TO THEORIZE THAT A THIRD SUCH CONFRONTATION TOOK PLACE.BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE HAVE HERE. WE DON'T HAVE ANY SIMILAR FACTS ON WHICH WE CAN HANG ANY SORT OF INFERENCE THAT THIS CRIME ON JUNE 12TH WAS DONE WITH A PARTICULAR INTENT, WITH A PARTICULAR MOTIVE OR WAS DONE BY A PARTICULAR PERSON.NOW, WHEN WE GET TO THE TRADITIONAL 1101(B) EXCEPTIONS, IT OCCURRED TO ME AGAIN THE PROSECUTION MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT. THEY HAVE A WONDERFUL THEORY IF THEY COULD SHOW THAT WHEN THE POLICE ARRIVED AT THE BUNDY PREMISES ON THE -- EARLY MORNING HOURS OF JUNE 13TH, 1994, THEY FOUND TWO DEAD BODIES AND THEY FOUND A LOT OF BROKEN PICTURE FRAMES WITH FAMILY PICTURES.WOULDN'T WE HAVE A STUNNING SIGNATURE KIND OF CASE IN WHICH WE COULD GO BACK TO PRIOR INCIDENTS OF BROKEN FAMILY PICTURES AND SAY, ""LOOK, LOOK AT WHAT WAS DONE HERE, AND WE CAN INFER THAT THE SAME THING WAS GOING ON ON JUNE 12TH""?AND THAT REALLY IS WHAT 1101(B) IS ALL ABOUT, WHEN YOU HAVE THOSE KIND OF SIMILAR FACTS. BUT HERE, THERE'S NO SUCH EVIDENCE. HERE, THE ONLY ISSUE WE WANT TO LITIGATE IS WHO WAS THERE JUNE 12TH AND COMMITTED THESE HOMICIDES.AND WE'RE SAYING WE'RE READY AND WILLING TO LITIGATE THAT ISSUE ON THE BASIS OF WHAT YOU DID FIND ON THE SIDEWALK. IN FACT, WE'RE WITHDRAWING OUR OBJECTIONS AND LETTING ALL OF THAT EVIDENCE COME IN BECAUSE THAT IS THE EVIDENCE THE JURY SHOULD LOOK AT IN TERMS OF DECIDING THIS CASE IN WHICH THE ONLY REAL ISSUE IS WHO COMMITTED THESE KILLINGS.NOW, THE TREASURE TROVE CASE OF EWOLDT, I FOUND IT AMUSING THAT A CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT OPINION WITHIN THE LAST YEAR HAS SOMEHOW BEEN APPROPRIATED AS A SECRET TREASURE TROVE OF THE PROSECUTION. THE REASON WE POINTED THE COURT'S ATTENTION TO EWOLDT WAS BECAUSE IT IS THE LAST WORD FROM THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT WITH RESPECT TO THE MEANING OF THE 1101(B) EXCEPTIONS.AND THE GUIDING PRINCIPAL THAT THE COURT SETS FORTH IN EWOLDT IS THAT PRINCIPAL OF SIMILARITY. AND THEY HAVE SIMPLY LAID OUT AN ATTEMPT TO QUANTIFY HOW MUCH SIMILARITY YOU NEED FOR EACH OF THE VARIOUS THEORIES THAT YOU ARE PURSUING.AND THEY POINT OUT FIRST OF ALL THAT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MOTIVE OR INTENT AS THE THEORY, THAT UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES ORDINARILY, THE IDENTITY HAS BEEN ASSUMED. WE KNOW WHO DID IT AND WE'RE LOOKING AT WHY THEY DID IT OR WHAT INTENT THEY DID IT WITH.AND IF OUR REAL PURPOSE IS TO SHOW IDENTITY, TO SHOW THAT THE SAME PERPETRATOR DID THESE PRIOR ACTS AND DID THE ACT FOR WHICH HE IS NOW ON TRIAL, WE HAVE THE STRONGEST NEED FOR SIMILARITY, THAT THE SIMILARITY MUST RISE TO THE LEVEL OF SIGNATURE FACTS.NOW, EWOLDT WAS NEITHER. EWOLDT WAS A SITUATION THE COURT DEFINED AS KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE IN TERMS OF COMMON DESIGN OR PLAN.BUT EVEN IN TERMS OF SHOWING A SERIES OF ACTS WITH A COMMON DESIGN OR PLAN, THE COURT INSISTED ON A GOOD DEAL OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE ACTS BEFORE WE COULD INFER THAT THEY WERE PART OF A COMMON DESIGN OR PLAN.AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK IN EWOLDT AT HOW MUCH SIMILARITY THERE ACTUALLY WAS BETWEEN THE PRIOR ACTS OF ABUSE OF A STEP CHILD AND THE CURRENT ACT OF ABUSE OF A STEP CHILD FOR WHICH THE DEFENDANT WAS ON TRIAL.THE COURT SAID IN THE PRESENT CASE:""THE VICTIMS OF BOTH THE UNCHARGED MISCONDUCT AND THE CHARGED OFFENSES WERE THE DEFENDANT'S STEPDAUGHTERS WHO WERE RESIDING IN THE DEFENDANT'S HOME AND THE ACTS OCCURRED WHEN THE VICTIMS WERE OF A SIMILAR AGE.""ON THREE OCCASIONS, THE DEFENDANT MOLESTED NATALIE AT NIGHT WHILE SHE WAS ASLEEP IN HER BED. AND WHEN HE WAS DISCOVERED, THE DEFENDANT ASSERTED HE WAS ONLY STRAIGHTENING UP THE COVERS.""NATALIE WAS THE VICTIM OF THE PRIOR UNCHARGED OFFENSES.""IN TWO OF THE CHARGED OFFENSES, THE DEFENDANT MOLESTED JENNIFER IN AN ALMOST IDENTICAL FASHION COMING INTO HER BEDROOM MOLESTING HER, AND THEN WHEN SHE AWOKE, OFFERING THE EXCUSE THAT HE WAS FIXING THE COVERS.""SO SIGNATURE FACTS AGAIN, VERY CLOSE FACTUAL SIMILARITY FROM WHICH WE CAN DRAW AN INFERENCE THAT THESE ACTS WERE PART OF A COMMON DESIGN OR PLAN.WE HAVE NO SUCH SIMILARITIES IN THIS CASE. AGAIN AND AGAIN, WE HAVE CHALLENGED THE PEOPLE TO SHOW US WHERE ARE THE SIMILARITIES.WHERE IS THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN A FIGHT ON NEW YEAR'S EVE WHERE BOTH PARTIES HAVE BEEN DRINKING, AT LEAST SOME SLAPPING AND WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT SIDEWALK ON JUNE 12TH, 1994?WHERE IS THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN PEOPLE ARGUING ABOUT WHETHER SOMEBODY HAS HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK AND WHO SHOULD DRIVE CARS BACK FROM A RESTAURANT AND WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT SIDEWALK ON JUNE 12TH, 1994?THERE'S JUST NO SIMILARITY HERE.FINALLY, WITH RESPECT TO THE 1101(B) EXCEPTION, WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF 352. THAT IS, ASSUMING WE FIND ENOUGH SIMILARITY TO SAY 1101(B) APPLIES, WE STILL HAVE TO LOOK UNDER 352 AT WHETHER THE DANGER OF SUBSTANTIAL PREJUDICE OF CONFUSING THE JURY OF UNDUE CONSUMPTION OF TIME, OF MISLEADING THE JURY OUTWEIGHS WHATEVER PROBATIVE VALUE THIS EVIDENCE MIGHT HAVE.AND HERE, YOUR HONOR, I CAN NOT STRESS TOO MUCH THE IMPORTANCE OF LOOKING AT THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THIS EVIDENCE WILL BE USED IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL PREJUDICIAL IMPACT.I MEAN IF WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF THE TRIAL WHERE THE ONLY ISSUE REALLY IN CONTENTION IS, DID MR. SIMPSON DO IT, AND THE PEOPLE COME IN SAYING, ""WELL, WE WANT TO OFFER THIS TO EXPLAIN A RELATIONSHIP, WE WANT TO OFFER THIS TO SUGGEST A MOTIVE RELATED TO ESTRANGEMENT,"" WE HAVE TO ASSESS WHETHER A JURY IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO LIMIT THEIR CONSIDERATION OF THEIR EVIDENCE TO JUST THAT ISSUE OR WHETHER IN FACT THEY WON'T REALLY USE IT AS EVIDENCE OF IDENTITY AND USE IT AS EVIDENCE OF IDENTITY WITHOUT THE REQUISITE SIGNATURE FACTS THAT ARE DEMANDED BY THE LAW.THAT IS THE REAL RISK OF PREJUDICE THAT WE FACE IN THIS CASE. AND I THINK THAT THE RISK IS A VERY, VERY SUBSTANTIAL ONE WITH RESPECT TO MUCH OF THIS EVIDENCE; THAT THERE IS GREAT DANGER THAT IT WOULD BE MISUSED BY THE JURY, THAT THE JURY WOULD BE MISLED AND CONFUSED BY IT.WITH RESPECT TO WHAT KIND OF PREJUDICE MIGHT ENSUE, I FOUND A VERY INTERESTING CONTRAST BETWEEN MR. GOLDBERG'S ARGUMENT SAYING, ""WELL, IT'S REALLY SILLY TO BELIEVE THAT A JURY WOULD ACTUALLY LOOK AT THESE PRIOR INCIDENTS OF ASSAULTIVE BEHAVIOR AND SAY, 'WELL, BECAUSE THE DEFENDANT HADN'T BEEN CONVICTED OF THOSE ASSAULTIVE BEHAVIORS, WE'RE GOING TO CONVICT HIM NOW OF A DOUBLE MURDER,'"" THAT THAT SOMEHOW KIND OF PREJUDICE OCCURRING IN A TRIAL WAS BEYOND BELIEF.AND THEN MR. GORDON GOT UP AND MR. GORDON SAID, ""YOU KNOW WHY WE'RE HERE. WE'RE HERE BECAUSE OF A FAILURE OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM LET NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON DOWN.""I DON'T THINK WE COULD HAVE A BETTER EXAMPLE OF THE PREJUDICIAL IMPACT THIS KIND OF EVIDENCE CAN HAVE TO SAY TO A JURY, ""WE LET THIS VICTIM DOWN, BUT NOW WE CAN MAKE UP FOR IT BY CONVICTING THIS MAN OF MURDER BECAUSE HE WASN'T CONVICTED. HE WASN'T BROUGHT TO JUSTICE FOR ALL OF THIS PRIOR ASSAULTIVE BEHAVIOR,"" AND THAT IS A TRUE SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF PREJUDICE IN THIS CASE.THE OTHER ASPECT OF 352 THAT WAS DISCUSSED WAS THE QUESTION OF UNDUE CONSUMPTION OF TIME, THAT SOMEHOW THE DEFENSE WAS IN A POSTURE HERE OF BLACKMAILING THE COURT IN SAYING, ""WELL, IF WE HAVE TO LITIGATE ALL OF THE NUANCES OF ALL OF THESE PRIOR INCIDENTS, WE'RE GOING TO BE STUCK IN THIS TRIAL FOR A VERY LONG TIME LITIGATING A LOT OF ISSUES OF VERY LIMITED RELEVANCE.""I FIND IT CURIOUS TO SUGGEST THAT THAT IS SOME SORT OF BLACKMAIL BY THE DEFENSE WHEN THE DEFENSE IS ONLY PUT IN THAT POSITION AFTER THE PROSECUTION USES A TABLOID BOOK AS KIND OF A SLUDGE DREDGE TO LOOK THROUGH A 17-YEAR RELATIONSHIP AND COME UP WITH EVERY CONCEIVABLE WITNESS, MANY OF WHOM THEY NOW RECOGNIZE ARE OF HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE CREDIBILITY AND TO BRING THAT ALL IN AND SAY, ""WE WANT TO OFFER THIS IN EVIDENCE IN THIS TRIAL AND TO KEEP EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF THIS CASE FAR BEYOND THE QUESTION WITH WHICH MR. SIMPSON WAS CONFRONTED BY THE CHARGES THAT WERE FILED AGAINST HIM LAST JUNE OF WHETHER IN FACT HE COMMITTED THIS MURDER.""NOW, LET ME ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF THE WHOLE ISSUE OF BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME AND ITS RELEVANCE TO THIS TRIAL.WE'RE TOLD THAT WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE OF THE BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME AND UNBROKEN PATTERN OF ESCALATING VIOLENCE CULMINATING IN A MURDER JUNE 12TH, 1994.AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS WHEEL OF THE BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME, I THINK WE RECOGNIZE IMMEDIATELY THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF SPOKES MISSING FROM THIS WHEEL. THERE ARE A LOT OF EXCEPTIONS TO WHAT IS CALLED THE TEXTBOOK PATTERN OF THE BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME.FOR EXAMPLE, NONE OF THE INCIDENTS OR THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED TO THE COURT IN THE COURSE OF THIS HEARING SUGGESTS ANY USE OF ECONOMIC ABUSE BY THE DEFENDANT IN ORDER TO CONTROL THE VICTIM IN THIS CASE. AND I CAN MAKE A BRIEF OFFER OF PROOF.WE BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE WILL SHOW QUITE TO THE CONTRARY; THAT FROM THE BEGINNING OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP, MR. SIMPSON ENCOURAGED NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON TO BE ECONOMICALLY INDEPENDENT. HE ENCOURAGED HER TO START HER OWN BUSINESS, TO BECOME SELF-SUFFICIENT. HE RECOMMENDED HER TO MANY FRIENDS IN TERMS OF HER INTERIOR DECORATING ABILITIES.AT ALL TIMES THROUGHOUT THEIR MARRIAGE, THEY MAINTAINED SEPARATE CHECKING ACCOUNTS. SO MRS. SIMPSON NEVER HAD TO ASK PERMISSION TO WRITE A CHECK. SHE HAD HER OWN CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS.WHEN THEY WERE MARRIED, MR. SIMPSON MADE A GIFT TO MRS. SIMPSON OF A CONDO WORTH $500,000 WHICH BROUGHT HER A MONTHLY INCOME OF ABOUT $3,000 WHICH -- FOR WHICH SHE WAS TOTALLY NOT DEPENDENT ON MR. SIMPSON.HE PURCHASED FOR HER A FERRARI AUTOMOBILE, A MERCEDES AND A PORSCHE AUTOMOBILE AND ALL OF THOSE AUTOMOBILES WERE PUT IN HER OWN NAME. SHE WAS GIVEN COMPLETE CONTROL OVER THOSE VEHICLES.NOW, THERE WAS A BRIEF SUGGESTION THAT BECAUSE MR. SIMPSON AT SOME POINT COMPLAINED I BELIEVE IT WAS TO ONE OF A MEMBER OF MRS. SIMPSON'S FAMILY THAT HE WAS PAYING FOR THE DINNERS FOR HER BOYFRIENDS, IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT THIS WAS SOME SORT OF ATTEMPT TO EXERT ECONOMIC CONTROL.AND THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW WHAT REALLY HAPPENED WAS, DURING THE PENDENCY OF THEIR DIVORCE, WHILE MR. SIMPSON WAS PAYING $25,000 A MONTH IN TEMPORARY SUPPORT, MRS. SIMPSON TOOK KEITH ZLOMSOWITCH TO DINNER AT A GOLF CLUB IN LAGUNA AND CHARGED IT TO MR. SIMPSON'S ACCOUNT.NOW, IS THAT ECONOMIC BLACKMAIL? IS THAT AN ATTEMPT TO EXERT CONTROL WHEN HE PROTESTS THAT THAT KIND OF ENTERTAINMENT IS STILL BEING BILLED TO HIM AT A TIME WHEN HE IS ALREADY PAYING SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF TEMPORARY SUPPORT?THE SUGGESTION CONCERNING THIS TAX FRAUD INVESTIGATION, THAT THAT IS SOME SORT OF INTIMIDATION I THINK HAS BEEN FULLY EXPLAINED. AND IF YOUR HONOR LOOKS AT THE LETTER THAT WAS WRITTEN AND SEES THAT THE ONLY POINT BEING MADE IS THAT MR. SIMPSON CANNOT PARTICIPATE IN A FRAUD ON THE GOVERNMENT BY HAVING MRS. SIMPSON CLAIM THAT HER PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE IS HIS HOME, THAT'S THE ONLY POINT THE LETTER MAKES. IT DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO COERCE HER IN ANY WAY OR THREATEN HER OR EXERT CONTROL OVER HER.SO THAT SPOKE IS TOTALLY MISSING FROM THIS PICTURE OF ANY SORT OF ECONOMIC ABUSE.LIKEWISE MISSING IS ANY SUGGESTION THAT MR. SIMPSON EVER USED THE CHILDREN AS A MEANS OF CONTROL OVER HIS WIFE OR HIS FORMER WIFE. IN FACT, ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS, THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT HE WAS COMPLIMENTARY OF HER ABILITY AS A MOTHER AND VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE DECISIONS SHE WAS MAKING WITH RESPECT TO THE RAISING OF THE CHILDREN.THE ONLY TIME THE CHILDREN EVER CAME UP IN ANY OF ALL OF THESE INCIDENTS THAT WE HAVE GONE THROUGH ITEM BY ITEM WAS WITH RESPECT TO THE ZLOMSOWITCH INCIDENT WHEN MR. SIMPSON RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT SEXUAL ACTIVITY TAKING PLACE IN HIS HOME WHILE HIS CHILDREN WERE PRESENT AND COULD POSSIBLY ACCIDENTALLY INTERRUPT OR OBSERVE THAT ACTIVITY GOING ON.THE SUGGESTION THAT SOMEHOW AN AUDIT TRAIL CONFIRMS THE PRESENCE OF A BATTERING RELATIONSHIP SUGGESTS THAT THE ONLY MOTIVATION FOR MRS. SIMPSON TO MAINTAIN EVIDENCE OF ASSAULTIVE BEHAVIOR IN A SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX WAS FOR SOME POTENTIAL CRIMINAL CONSEQUENCES OF ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR.BUT THE FACTS WILL SHOW THAT ALL OF THIS TOOK PLACE IN THE WAKE OF THE 1989 INCIDENT, THAT PART OF THE AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO AS A RESULT OF THAT INCIDENT WAS MR. SIMPSON AGREEING THAT IF HE EVER STRUCK OR LAID A HAND ON MRS. SIMPSON AGAIN, THE PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT WOULD BE VOIDABLE, AND THAT IT MIGHT SUGGEST A MOTIVE WHY AN AUDIT TRAIL WOULD BE MAINTAINED IN THIS CASE IN CASE MRS. SIMPSON EVER WANTED TO TRY TO EXERCISE THAT OPTION.AND I THINK IT'S SIGNIFICANT THAT NEVER ONCE WAS THAT OPTION EXERCISED EVEN IN THE COURSE OF A CONTENTIOUS DIVORCE PROCEEDING THREE YEARS LATER.IN THE COURSE OF THAT DIVORCE PROCEEDING, IN A DEPOSITION, THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW MRS. SIMPSON STATED UNDER OATH THAT SINCE THE 1989 INCIDENT, THAT O.J. SIMPSON HAD NEVER LAID A HAND ON HER.NOW, WHAT DOES THAT SUGGEST IN TERMS OF A TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE OF BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME? WHAT IT SUGGESTS TO ME IS THAT INTERVENTION WORKED; THAT IN THE WAKE OF THAT INCIDENT, WHEN MR. SIMPSON WENT TO COURT, PLED NO CONTEST, WAS GIVEN AS A CONDITION OF PROBATION THAT HE UNDERGO COUNSELING, THAT THAT COUNSELING WAS ACTUALLY QUITE SUCCESSFUL. THE PHYSICAL ABUSE CAME TO AN ABRUPT HALT. THERE WAS NO VIOLENCE IN ANY INCIDENT THEREAFTER.I MEAN EVEN LOOKING AT ALL OF THE ALLEGATIONS DREDGED UP BY THE PROSECUTION. AND I THINK WE CAN REST ASSURED THAT THEY HAVE DONE A COMPLETE INVESTIGATION OF ANY INCIDENT OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE.THE ONLY INCIDENT AFTER 1989, AFTER JANUARY 1ST WAS THE ALLEGED INCIDENT INVOLVING THE AUTOMOBILE AND THE PUSHING AND SHOVING OF WHO WAS GOING TO GET IN WHAT AUTOMOBILE. AND APPARENTLY WHILE ONE WITNESS TO THAT INCIDENT CLAIMS THAT IT WAS AN EXAMPLE OF PHYSICAL ABUSE, IT WAS NOT CONSTRUED AS SUCH BY NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, BECAUSE IN HER DEPOSITION, SHE SAID SINCE THE 1989 INCIDENT, O.J. HAD NOT LAID A HAND ON HER.AND THAT'S THE ONLY ALLEGATION.OF COURSE, THERE ARE FIVE OTHER WITNESSES TO THAT INCIDENT WHO MAY GIVE A VERY DIFFERENT VERSION. BUT WE HAVE ACTUALLY NOT ONE SINGLE BIT OF EVIDENCE OF ANY PHYSICAL ASSAULTIVE BEHAVIOR OR ABUSE TOWARD THE VICTIM AFTER JANUARY 1ST, 1989 WHEN THAT INTERVENTION TOOK PLACE.THE PROBLEM WITH THIS WHEEL OF THE BATTERED WOMAN'S SYNDROME IS THAT IT IS A WHEEL, AND WHEELS CAN SPIN, AND THIS WHEEL CAN PUT A SPIN ON EVERYTHING THAT MR. SIMPSON DOES OVER THE COURSE OF A 17-YEAR RELATIONSHIP.IF HE BRINGS FLOWERS TO THE DOORSTEP, HE'S CONTROLLING. IF HE APOLOGIZES, HE'S MINIMIZING. IF HE CRITICIZES HIS WIFE FOR SEXUAL ESCAPADES IN THE VIEW OF PASSERSBY, HE'S HUMILIATING HER. IF HE BREAKS HER FAMILY PICTURES, HE'S DEMEANING HER. IF HE BREAKS HIS FAMILY PICTURES, WE ASSUME HE'S ACTING LIKE THE MASTER OF THE CASTLE.SO IT'S A SPINNING WHEEL THAT CAN PUT A SPIN ON ALL OF THIS BEHAVIOR. AND THIS IS NOT TO MINIMIZE SPOUSAL ABUSE. WE DON'T INTEND TO MINIMIZE IT AT ALL. THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR.BUT WHAT WE'RE REALLY LEFT WITH IN THIS CASE IS A RECORD OF OCCASIONAL LAPSES IN THE COURSE OF A 17-YEAR RELATIONSHIP THAT DON'T EVEN FIT THE CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF WHAT THE BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME IS. BUT EVEN IF IT DID, THE QUESTION THAT THIS COURT REALLY FACES IS WHAT WOULD THAT PROVE? WOULD THAT PROVE THAT MR. SIMPSON IS THE PERPETRATOR OF A MURDER BECAUSE HE WAS THE PERPETRATOR OF ABUSE IN A BATTERING RELATIONSHIP?AND EVEN THE EXPERT PRESENTED BY THE PEOPLE WOULD NOT VENTURE OUT ON TO THAT LIMB, WOULD NOT SAY THAT BASED ON THE EARMARKS OF THE BATTERING WOMEN'S SYNDROME, WE CAN MAKE ANY SORT OF PREDICTION AS TO WHETHER THE BATTERER IN THAT RELATIONSHIP IS LIKELY TO BE THE PERPETRATOR OF A HOMICIDE.AND THE REASON HE WOULDN'T VENTURE OUT ON TO THAT LIMB IS BECAUSE HE WAS QUITE HONEST AND FRANK IN ADMITTING THAT THAT'S REALLY NOT THE PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH THAT HAS BEEN DONE WITH RESPECT TO THE BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME. THE REAL PURPOSE IS TO EXPLAIN THE CONDUCT OF THE VICTIMS.AND WHEN THE STATE LEGISLATURE INDICATED THAT UNDER LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, EVIDENCE OF THE BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME WILL BE ADMISSIBLE IN A CRIMINAL TRIAL, THEY DELINEATED WHAT THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD BE, WHERE IT MIGHT BE RELEVANT TO PROVE THE STATE OF MIND OF THE VICTIM.AND THE REFERENCE TO THE POSSIBLE USE OF THAT EVIDENCE BY THE PROSECUTION WAS EXPLAINED IN THE LEGISLATIVE REPORTS AS WHERE IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO EXPLAIN WHY A VICTIM REFUSES TO CORROBORATE OR RECANTS OR WON'T TESTIFY AGAINST THE BATTERER AND THE PROSECUTION WANTS TO CARRY ON THE PROSECUTION OF THE BATTERER. UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, BRINGING IN EVIDENCE OF THE BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME WILL EXPLAIN THE STATE OF MIND OF THE VICTIM, BUT IT CAN'T BE USED AS EVIDENCE TO SHOW IT'S MORE LIKELY THAT THE BATTERER DID THE ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR WITH WHICH HE IS ACCUSED.AND THAT EXCEPTION REALLY GETS TO THE HEART OF WHAT THE PROSECUTION WANTS TO DO WITH THE BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE TO EXPLAIN ANY CONDUCT OF THE VICTIM. THERE ISN'T ANY CONDUCT OF THE VICTIM THAT IS IN ISSUE IN THIS CASE.IT'S SIMPLY NOT SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO LITIGATE, THAT NEEDS TO BE EXPLAINED. ITS ONLY PURPOSE IS TO DRAW AN INFERENCE THAT IF SHE WAS THE VICTIM OF A BATTERING RELATIONSHIP, THEN MR. SIMPSON WAS A BATTERER; AND, THEREFORE, IT'S MORE LIKELY THAT HE COMMITTED THIS MURDER ON JUNE 12TH, 1994. AND THAT IS PRECISELY THE USE OF THIS EVIDENCE THAT IS FORBIDDEN BY SECTION 1107 OF THE EVIDENCE CODE.I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN OUR READING OF BLEDSOE AND BOWKER AND ARIS AND THE PEOPLE'S READING OF THOSE CASES.WHAT'S SIGNIFICANT IS THAT IN ENACTING 1107, THE LEGISLATURE HAD THE SAME UNDERSTANDING AS WE DO OF THOSE CASES AND DID NOT INTEND TO IN ANY WAY DISTURB THE FORCE OF THOSE RULINGS AND WANTED TO ENACT A RULE THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE RULINGS, THAT THIS SYNDROME EVIDENCE WILL NOT BE ADMISSIBLE FOR THE PURPOSE TO WHICH THE PEOPLE INTEND TO PUT IT.ONE OF THE POTENTIAL USES OF THIS BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME, EXPERT TESTIMONY WAS REVEALED IN A VERY INTERESTING WAY BY MS. BODIN'S ARGUMENT WHERE SHE SUGGESTED THAT WHAT THEY REALLY WANTED TO DO WITH ALL OF THIS HEARSAY EVIDENCE THAT THEY RECOGNIZE MAY NOT BE ADMISSIBLE WAS TO PUT THE DEFENSE ON NOTICE, AND SHE EXPLAINED WHAT WE WERE BEING PUT ON NOTICE OF.WE WERE BEING PUT ON NOTICE THAT IF THE DEFENDANT TESTIFIES, SOME OF THIS MAY BE USED TO IMPEACH HIS TESTIMONY. AND THAT OF COURSE IS A RISK WE'RE WELL AWARE OF. WE DON'T NEED TO BE PUT ON NOTICE OF THAT.BUT SECONDLY, SHE SAYS, ""AND WE'RE GOING TO BE CALLING AN EXPERT, AND HEARSAY EVIDENCE IS USABLE BY AN EXPERT TO EXPLAIN THE BASIS OF THE OPINION TO WHICH THE EXPERT COMES IF IT IS INFORMATION THAT EXPERTS IN THIS FIELD ORDINARILY RELY ON.""AND AT THAT POINT, A LITTLE ALARM SIGNAL STARTED GOING OFF IN MY HEAD; THAT THE REAL AGENDA HERE WITH TRYING TO BRING IN A BATTERED WOMEN'S EXPERT MAY SIMPLY BE TO FIND A WAY TO FUNNEL IN ALL OF THE INADMISSIBLE HEARSAY BY HAVING THE EXPERT COME IN AND SAY, ""WELL, MY OPINION IS BASED ON THIS AND THIS AND THIS AND THIS,"" ALL OF WHICH IS NOT ADMISSIBLE BECAUSE IT'S HEARSAY.AND THEN WE'LL INSTRUCT THE JURY THAT THEY SHOULDN'T CONSIDER IT FOR THE TRUTH OF WHAT WAS BEING ASSERTED, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT IT SUPPORTS THE OPINION OF THE EXPERT.SO THERE IS A VERY SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF PREJUDICE, OF THE ATTEMPTING TO BRING IN THROUGH THE BACK DOOR INADMISSIBLE HEARSAY EVIDENCE IN THE EMPLOYMENT OF THIS BATTERED WOMEN'S EXPERT AS WELL. AND I THINK THE LEGISLATURE WAS WELL AWARE OF THOSE KINDS OF DANGERS WHEN IT ENACTED THE PARTICULAR EXCEPTION IT ENACTED TO SECTION 1107.NOW, LET ME TURN TO THE HEARSAY PROBLEMS IN THIS CASE.A PRINCIPAL HEARSAY PROBLEM IS GOING TO BE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE 911 TAPES. AND THERE ARE TWO 911 TAPES.THE 911 TAPE FOR THE 1989 INCIDENT WE WILL OBJECT TO AS SIMPLY IRRELEVANT. YOUR HONOR WILL NOTE -- AND YOU HAVE A TRANSCRIPT OF THAT 911 CALL NOW -- THAT THE LEGEND INCLUDES AN END FOR THE STATEMENT OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON IN THAT CALL. AND THEN YOU READ THROUGH THE TRANSCRIPT, AND YOU WON'T FIND AN END ANYWHERE IN THERE.THERE IS NOT ONE UTTERANCE IN THAT ENTIRE TRANSCRIPT THAT IS ATTRIBUTED TO NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON. THE TRANSCRIPT IS SIMPLY A TRANSCRIPT OF SOMEBODY SCREAMING OVER THE BACKGROUND OF A 911 OPERATOR.AND WE WILL CONTEND THAT EVIDENCE OF THAT NATURE WOULD BE EXTREMELY PREJUDICIAL. IT WOULD HAVE NO PROBATIVE VALUE. IT SHOULD BE EXCLUDED NOT JUST AS HEARSAY, BUT BECAUSE IT WOULD VIOLATE 352. IT GETS US NOWHERE IN TERMS OF EXPLAINING THAT INCIDENT OR WHAT HAPPENED.THE 1993 TAPE PRESENTS A MUCH MORE DIFFICULT PROBLEM FOR THE COURT. AND I DON'T THINK YOUR HONOR CAN SIMPLY RULE THAT THAT TAPE IS ADMISSIBLE OR NOT ADMISSIBLE WITHOUT CAREFULLY EXAMINING THE DIALOGUE THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE COURSE OF THAT 14-MINUTE CONVERSATION.SIMPLY SAYING THAT THIS IS A SPONTANEOUS STATEMENT DOES NOT MAKE THE WHOLE 14-MINUTE CONVERSATION ADMISSIBLE. THERE WERE PARTS OF THAT CONVERSATION IN WHICH A VERY LUCID, CALM CONVERSATION WAS TAKING PLACE IN RESPONSE TO VERY PROBING QUESTIONS. IT WAS NOT SPONTANEOUS AT ALL.AND EVEN WITH RESPECT TO THOSE VERY DISCREET PARTS OF THE TRANSCRIPT THAT MIGHT BE LABELED SPONTANEOUS, THEY CONTAIN MANY EXPRESSIONS OF OPINION. AND WE CONTEND -- AND I'VE LOOKED AT GARCIA, AND I DON'T THINK GARCIA UNDERCUTS THIS POSITION AT ALL.IN FACT, WE RELY ON PEOPLE VERSUS MYRON, M-Y-R-O-N, A CASE THAT IS CITED IN OUR BRIEF FOR THE PROPOSITION THAT EVEN WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF SPONTANEOUS DECLARATIONS, THERE MAY BE EXPRESSIONS OF OPINION THAT ARE NOT ADMISSIBLE, THAT DO NOT COME WITHIN THE HEARSAY EXCEPTION.THE TASK FOR THE COURT IN LOOKING AT THAT IS I THINK WELL LAID OUT IN THE CASE OF PEOPLE VERSUS FARMER.AND IN FARMER, THE COURT INDICATED THAT THE CRUCIAL ELEMENTS IN DETERMINING WHETHER A DECLARATION IS SUFFICIENTLY RELIABLE TO BE ADMISSIBLE UNDER THAT EXCEPTION TO THE HEARSAY RULE IS NOT THE NATURE OF THE STATEMENT, BUT THE MENTAL STATE OF THE SPEAKER.AND THE REASON THAT THE COURT IN FARMER FOUND THAT A 911 TAPE WAS ADMISSIBLE AS A SPONTANEOUS STATEMENT WAS BECAUSE OF THE MENTAL STATE OF THE SPEAKER, WHO HAD JUST BEEN SHOT AND WAS EXPERIENCING SEVERE PAIN AT THE TIME HE WAS SPEAKING INTO THE TELEPHONE.AND THE COURT RECOGNIZED -- IT SAID:""IT IS TRUE THAT WE HAVE RARELY HELD THE ANSWERS TO SUCH EXTENSIVE QUESTIONING TO BE SPONTANEOUS UTTERANCES. NONETHELESS, THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE DECLARANT HERE, SCHMIDT HILL, WAS EXCITED OR PERHAPS MORE ACCURATELY DISTRAUGHT AND IN SEVERE PAIN. HE WAS NOT MERELY AN UNINJURED PERSON WHOSE EXCITEMENT MIGHT WANE AND THUS BE IN A POSITION TO FABRICATE ANSWERS THROUGH THE SOBERING INTERROGATION OF AN INVESTIGATOR.""WHILE HE WAS BEING QUESTIONED, THE INTENSE PAIN OF HIS GUNSHOT WOUNDS AND THE CONCERN HE RIGHTLY HAD ABOUT HIS SURVIVAL NO DOUBT PREOCCUPIED HIM SO HE COULD NOT HAVE CONTEMPLATED SPINNING A FALSE TALE.""AND THAT'S VERY TELLING BECAUSE FROM THIS 911 CALL, WE DO HAVE AN UNINJURED WITNESS WHO HAS NOT BEEN PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED, WHOSE EXCITEMENT MIGHT WANE AND DOES WANE. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE WANING IS VERY APPARENT IN A READING OF THE TRANSCRIPT OF THAT 911 CALL.NOW, THE OTHER HEARSAY -- AND AGAIN, IN OUR OPENING ARGUMENT, WE CHALLENGED THE PEOPLE TO SAY, WELL, COME UP WITH A PLAUSIBLE HEARSAY EXCEPTION UNDER WHICH ALL OF THESE STATEMENTS OF THE NICOLE -- OF THE VICTIM, NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, TO OTHER THIRD PARTIES COULD COME IN AS AN EXCEPTION TO THE HEARSAY RULE. AND THE ONLY EXCEPTION THAT THEY COULD COME UP WITH -- AND IT'S CITED WITH RESPECT TO THE REMAINING HEARSAY THAT THEY STILL HAVE ON THE LIST, AND I'LL GO THROUGH THESE ITEMS VERY QUICKLY JUST TO RESTATE OUR OBJECTIONS.THE HEARSAY THAT IS STILL ON THIS LIST, THE ONLY LEGAL THEORY OFFERED BY THE PEOPLE IS SECTION 1250 OF THE CALIFORNIA EVIDENCE CODE. AND THEY'RE SAYING THAT 1250 ALLOWS STATEMENTS OF FEAR, OF STATE OF MIND TO SHOW THE DECLARANT'S STATE OF MIND OR TO EXPLAIN THE DECLARANT'S CONDUCT.THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THAT THE DECLARANT'S STATE OF MIND AND THE DECLARANT'S CONDUCT IS NOT IN ISSUE IN THIS CASE.THERE IS NOTHING TO PROVE WITH RESPECT TO THE STATE OF MIND OR THE CONDUCT OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON WITH RESPECT TO THE EVENTS THAT TOOK PLACE ON THE EVENING OF JUNE 12TH. THE ATTEMPTS TO COME UP WITH SUCH AN EXPLANATION -- AND I HAVE -- IF I COULD JUST HAVE A MOMENT.
","JANUARY 12, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
#MR. UELMEN: ,"HERE THEY ARE.IT WAS SUGGESTED, FIRST OF ALL, THAT THIS EVIDENCE MIGHT SHOW THAT THE VICTIM WAS TAKEN BY SURPRISE; THAT IF IN FACT SHE HAD A FEAR OF MR. SIMPSON, SHE WOULD NOT HAVE GONE OUTSIDE IF SHE KNEW THE DEFENDANT WAS OUT THERE. AND OF COURSE, THAT ASSUMES THAT THE DEFENDANT WAS OUT THERE.THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE ANY DISPUTE ABOUT THAT. THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE ANY CONTENTS IN THIS CASE THAT THESE TWO VICTIMS WERE NOT TAKEN BY SURPRISE. WE BELIEVE THEY WERE. THEY WERE TAKEN BY SURPRISE BY THE PERSONS WHO COMMITTED THIS MURDER.THERE'S NO EXPLANATION NECESSARY TO SHOW WHY THERE WOULD BE ANY DEGREE OF CAUTION ON THE PART OF THE VICTIM THAT WOULD ARISE IN THE CONTEXT OF THESE PRIOR HEARSAY STATEMENTS.AND THE OTHER THEORY IS THAT THIS EXPLAINS ESTRANGEMENT; HER CONDUCT IN DISTANCING HERSELF SOMEHOW MOTIVATED THE MURDER, THAT THESE HEARSAY STATEMENTS WILL SHOW THAT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON WANTED TO DISENGAGE FROM MR. SIMPSON AND THAT SUPPLIES THE MOTIVE FOR HIM MURDERING HER.YOU KNOW, THAT'S A PLAUSIBLE THEORY IF MR. SIMPSON KNEW IT, BECAUSE THE STATE OF MIND THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PROVING AND THAT'S RELEVANT IN THIS CASE IN TERMS OF HIS MOTIVE FOR A MURDER ONLY ARISES IF HE KNEW IN FACT THAT THESE STATEMENTS WERE MADE, IF THESE STATEMENTS WERE MADE TO HIM OR THEY WERE COMMUNICATED TO HIM SOMEHOW.SO THE FACT THAT MRS. SIMPSON MAKES A CALL, FOR EXAMPLE, TO A BATTERED WOMAN'S SHELTER BEING OFFERED TO SHOW HER ESTRANGEMENT FROM HER HUSBAND AND HER ATTEMPT TO SEPARATE HERSELF FROM HIM PROVES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN TERMS OF HIS STATE OF MIND IF HE DIDN'T KNOW THAT CALL WAS EVER MADE.THE ISSUE IN THIS CASE IS NOT MS. SIMPSON'S STATE OF MIND, BUT MR. SIMPSON'S STATE OF MIND, WHAT HE KNEW IN TERMS OF ANY MOTIVE OF ESTRANGEMENT.WHAT I FIND REMARKABLE IS THAT THE ONLY EXCEPTION SEIZED UPON BY THE PEOPLE TO JUSTIFY THE ADMISSION OF THESE HEARSAY STATEMENTS IS SECTION 1250(T) OF THE EVIDENCE CODE, AND SECTION 1250 OF THE EVIDENCE CODE IS THE SAME EXCEPTION THAT WAS RELIED UPON IN IRELAND AND IN ARCEGA.I DON'T THINK WE COULD HAVE -- I MEAN THIS IS AN UNUSUAL POSITION FOR A DEFENSE POSITION TO HAVE, TO HAVE TWO RULINGS FROM THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT ON ALL FOURS DIRECTLY IN HIS OR HER FAVOR. SO I GUESS I WANT TO GLORY IN IT. I WANT TO REALLY RACK MYSELF UP IN THESE CASES BECAUSE THEY ARE PRECISELY ON POINT.THEY DEAL WITH PRECISELY THE SAME THEORY, THE SAME EXCEPTION. AND IN BOTH CASES, THE COURT SAID:""IT IS REVERSIBLE ERROR TO ENTER INTO EVIDENCE HEARSAY STATEMENTS OF THE VICTIM EXPRESSING FEAR OF THE DEFENDANT ACCUSED OF THE VICTIM'S MURDER ON THE VERY DAY THAT THE VICTIM WAS MURDERED.""YOU COULDN'T HAVE A STRONGER MORE TELLING STATEMENT OF A LEGAL PRINCIPAL THAN WE HAVE IN IRELAND AND ARCEGA, AND THAT SHOULD BE DETERMINATIVE OF THE ISSUE; THAT THIS HEARSAY WILL NOT BE ADMISSIBLE SIMPLY BECAUSE THE STATE OF MIND AND THE CONDUCT OF THE VICTIM IS NOT GOING TO BE AN ISSUE IN THIS CASE.NOW, TO CONCLUDE, WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS JUST TAKE A BRIEF MOMENT TO QUICKLY GO THROUGH THE APPRECIATED LIST THAT WE ARE NOW LEFT WITH AND EXPRESS FOR THE COURT THE GROUNDS OF THE DEFENDANT'S OBJECTIONS TO THE ADMISSION OF THESE REMAINING ITEMS.ITEM NUMBER 3, WE OBJECT TO ITS ADMISSION ON THE GROUND THAT IT IS HEARSAY. MR. HUGHES' EXPLANATION OF THIS RED SPOT IS SIMPLY RESTATING THE EXPLANATION THAT HE GOT FROM NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON. AND THERE IS NO FOUNDATIONAL SHOWING OF ANY EXCITED UTTERANCE IN THE COURSE OF THIS CONVERSATION BETWEEN MS. SIMPSON AND MR. HUGHES.AND WE ALSO OBJECT ON THE GROUNDS THAT IT IS IRRELEVANT UNDER SECTION 1101 AND THAT ITS PREJUDICIAL IMPACT WOULD OUTWEIGH ITS PROBATIVE VALUE UNDER SECTION 352.ITEM NUMBER 7, WE OBJECT VERY STRONGLY ON THE GROUNDS OF 1101 ON THE GROUND THAT THERE IS NO SIMILARITY. THERE IS NO SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE FACTS OF THIS INCIDENT AND THE MURDER THAT TOOK PLACE JUNE 12TH, 1994, AND ALSO ON GROUNDS OF 352, THAT ITS PROBATIVE VALUE IS OUTWEIGHED BY ITS PREJUDICIAL IMPACT.ITEM NUMBER 8, WE WILL RAISE INITIALLY A 403 OBJECTION PRELIMINARILY TO THE ADMISSION OF THIS EVIDENCE BECAUSE WE WILL CONTEND THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO ESTABLISH THE DEFENDANT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OF THE CONDUCT BEING DESCRIBED; THAT IS THE BREAKING OF PICTURE FRAMES. THE MAID SIMPLY DESCRIBES ENTERING THE HOME AND FINDING BROKEN PICTURE FRAMES WITHOUT ANY INDICATION OF WHO BROKE THEM.SO UNTIL THAT'S ESTABLISHED, WE HAVE A 403 OBJECTION. IF IT IS ESTABLISHED THAT MR. SIMPSON DID IT, WE WOULD CONTEND IT'S IRRELEVANT UNDER 1101, NO SIMILARITY. IT DOESN'T PROVE ANY FACT OR ISSUE IN THIS CASE, AND WE ALSO OBJECT ON GROUNDS OF 352.ITEM NUMBER 9, THE DAMAGE TO THE MERCEDES AUTOMOBILE, AN INTERESTING CONTENTION HERE BECAUSE WE INDICATE THAT THE EVIDENCE OF THIS WOULD COME FROM DETECTIVE FUHRMAN, WHO MADE NO CONTEMPORANEOUS ACCOUNT OF THE INCIDENT, BUT ONLY WROTE IT UP IN A LETTER FOUR YEARS LATER.AND THE PROSECUTORIAL RESPONSE WAS, ""WELL, WE DON'T JUST HAVE DETECTIVE FUHRMAN. WE HAVE A LOS ANGELES POLICE SERGEANT WHO FORMERLY WORKED FOR WESTEC SECURITY WHO ALSO WILL GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF THIS INCIDENT.""AND WHEN WE LOOKED THROUGH THE DISCOVERY -- AND I BELIEVE MARK DAY IS HIS NAME -- AT THE STATEMENT FOR MR. DAY, WE DISCOVERED THAT MR. DAY'S STATEMENT WAS DATED 1994. THAT IS, MR. DAY WAS SIMPLY RECOUNTING FROM MEMORY AFTER HE SPOKE TO MR. FUHRMAN OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED NINE YEARS BEFORE WHEN HE WAS WORKING AS A WESTEC SECURITY GUARD.AND WE BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE WILL ESTABLISH SUBSTANTIAL CONTRADICTIONS BETWEEN THE VERSION OF THIS EVENT PRESENTED BY DETECTIVE FUHRMAN AND THE VERSION OF THIS EVENT PRESENTED BY SERGEANT DAY.SO ON THAT GROUND, WE WILL ASK FOR A 403 DETERMINATION AS TO WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED BEFORE THE COURT ADMITS THE EVIDENCE, AND WE WILL OBJECT BOTH ON GROUNDS OF 1101, RELEVANCY, AND 352.THE BICYCLE INCIDENT, ITEM NUMBER 10, ALSO PRESENTS A SUBSTANTIAL 403 PRELIMINARY QUESTION BECAUSE THIS INCIDENT OF COURSE IS NOT GOING TO BE ADMISSIBLE UNLESS WE HAVE SOME EVIDENCE OF HOW THE INJURIES OCCURRED.AND SIMPLY BRINGING IN A PHYSICIAN WHO SAYS, ""WELL, I'M NOT SO SURE THAT I WAS BEING TOLD THE TRUTH WITH RESPECT TO THIS INJURY OCCURRING"" -- AND FALLING OFF A BICYCLE DOESN'T GET US VERY FAR IN TERMS OF EXPLAINING HOW THE INJURIES DID OCCUR -- THE INJURIES ARE TOTALLY IRRELEVANT UNLESS THEY WERE THE RESULT OF SOME SORT OF ASSAULTIVE BEHAVIOR BY MR. SIMPSON AND THAT BEHAVIOR HAS SOME SORT OF SIMILARITY TO THE BEHAVIOR INVOLVED IN THIS MURDER ON JUNE 12TH.SO WE'LL OBJECT IN TERMS OF 403 THAT THERE'S NO PRELIMINARY SHOWING THAT IT'S EVEN RELATED TO MR. SIMPSON, AND IF THAT OBSTACLE IS OVERCOME, ON THE GROUNDS OF BOTH 1101 AND 352.THE ""DISNEY ON ICE"" INCIDENT WE WILL OBJECT ON GROUNDS OF 1101 AND 352. THE INCIDENT BEARS NO SIMILARITY TO ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED WITH RESPECT TO THE COMMISSION OF THIS MURDER, AND THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL DANGER OF PREJUDICE OUTWEIGHING ITS PROBATIVE VALUE.ITEM NUMBER 13 OF COURSE IS THE JANUARY 1ST, 1989 INCIDENT THAT RESULTED IN A NO CONTEST PLEA IN A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING. SO THE OBJECTION HERE WILL BE THREEFOLD.FIRST OF ALL, UNDER 1101, THE LACK OF SIMILARITY OF THIS INCIDENT TO ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED JUNE 12TH MAKES IT IRRELEVANT. UNDER 352, ITS PROBATIVE VALUE IS FAR OUTWEIGHED BY ITS PREJUDICIAL IMPACT. AND THEN SEPARATELY, WE OBJECT ON THE GROUNDS OF HEARSAY TO THE USE OF THE 911 TAPE TO CORROBORATE THAT INCIDENT.THERE WILL BE NO OBJECTION TO THE LETTER IN WHICH THE DEFENDANT AGREES TO VOID THE PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT.OH, NUMBER 11. I NEED TO GO BACK.NUMBER 11 IS THE INCIDENT REFERRED TO AS HUMILIATION OF MRS. SIMPSON BY MR. SIMPSON'S EXPRESSIONS OF OUTRAGE THAT A GAY MAN HAD KISSED ONE OF THEIR CHILDREN.THERE'S GOING TO BE A 403 HEARING NECESSARY IF THIS INCIDENT IS OFFERED BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW A VERY DIFFERENT FACTUAL SCENARIO; THAT IN FACT MR. SIMPSON'S OUTRAGE WAS ENGENDERED BY A STATEMENT BY NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON CALLING MR. SIMPSON'S FATHER A FAG, KIND OF A REVERSE HUMILIATION.I THINK IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT ALL OF THE HUMILIATION IN THIS RELATIONSHIP WAS NOT A ONE-WAY STREET. AND WITH RESPECT TO THIS INCIDENT IN PARTICULAR, THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL VARIANCE IN THE EVIDENCE AS TO HOW IT HAPPENED AND WHAT ITS SIGNIFICANCE ACTUALLY IS.ONCE WE GET PAST THAT, WE WOULD CONTEND OF COURSE THAT IT BEARS NO SIMILARITY WHATSOEVER TO ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED IN 1994 AND ITS PREJUDICIAL IMPACT WOULD FAR OUTWEIGH ITS PROBATIVE VALUE.ITEM NO. 16, WE HAVE A VERY SIMPLE LETTER SAYING -- THERE'S AN OBJECTION TO THAT.THE ONLY EXCEPTION RELIED UPON IS 1250, AND WE WOULD ANSWER THAT BY SAYING THE STATE OF MIND OR THE CONDUCT OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON IS SIMPLY NOT GOING TO BE AN ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO THIS STATEMENT OR ANY STATEMENT MADE BY MS. SIMPSON.ITEM NUMBER 17, WE'RE IN A DIFFICULT POSITION BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANY DATES TO WHICH THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED WITHIN AN ENTIRE TWO-YEAR SPREAD. WE'RE SIMPLY TOLD THIS HAPPENED SOMETIME IN 1988 OR 1989.THE DATE BECOMES VERY SIGNIFICANT, YOUR HONOR, BECAUSE JANUARY 1ST, 1989 WAS THE INCIDENT LEADING TO THE AGREEMENT THAT THE PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT WOULD BE VOIDED IF THERE WAS ANY ACTIVE PHYSICAL ASSAULT. AND HERE WE HAVE A WITNESS THAT SAID, ""I SAW AN ACTIVE PHYSICAL ASSAULT. I SAW MR. SIMPSON BACK-HAND HIS WIFE IN THE BACK OF A LIMOUSINE EITHER IN 1988 OR 1989.""WE HAVE NO IDEA WHEN THIS OCCURRED. AND UNTIL THE PEOPLE CAN SPECIFY WITH SOME DEGREE OF CERTAINTY WHEN THIS HAPPENED, SOME OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES BY WHICH THIS MIGHT BE RECONSTRUCTED, WE BELIEVE THE DEFENDANT WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY PREJUDICED BY HAVING TO ANSWER TO A CHARGE LIKE THIS AS A CHARGE OF RELATED CONDUCT THAT HE HAS TO EXPLAIN SOMEHOW IN THE COURSE OF THIS TRIAL.ASSUMING WE GET OVER THAT OBSTACLE, OF COURSE WE STILL RESERVE ON 1101 AND A 352 OBJECTION ON THE GROUNDS THAT THIS BEARS NO SIMILARITY. THERE IS NO EXPLANATION OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES FROM WHICH THIS CAN EVEN BE TIED TO ANY EVENTS TAKING PLACE ON JUNE 12TH, 1994.THE RED ONION INCIDENT, NUMBER 18, AGAIN, WE HAVE AN 1101 AND A 352 OBJECTION ON THE GROUNDS THAT THERE IS NO SIMILARITY.ITEM 21, THERE WON'T BE ANY CONTENTION ABOUT THE FILING OF THE DIVORCE.ITEM 22, THE MEZZALUNA INCIDENT AND ITEM 23, THE TRYST INCIDENT, BOTH ALLEGES CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE MR. SIMPSON IS OBSERVED IN A RESTAURANT AT THE SAME TIME THAT MRS. SIMPSON IS. AND IN ONE CASE, IT IS ALLEGED HE STARED AT THE PEOPLE SHE WAS WITH, AND IN ANOTHER INCIDENT, HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THOSE PEOPLE.NOW, THE RELEVANCE OF THIS THE PEOPLE ARGUE IS THAT IT'S GOING TO SHOW STALKING. AND AT THIS POINT, I THINK IT'S WORTH THE COURT NOTING THAT STALKING IS A LEGAL TERM THAT HAS A LEGAL DEFINITION.THE CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE, SECTION 646.9 DEFINES STALKING TO ENCOMPASS ANY PERSON WILLFULLY, MALICIOUSLY AND REPEATEDLY FOLLOWING OR HARASSING ANOTHER PERSON.NOW, WE WILL IMPOSE A SIGNIFICANT AND SUBSTANTIAL 403 OBJECTION TO THE JURY HEARING ANY OF THIS EVIDENCE UNTIL IT IS ESTABLISHED THAT WHAT IS ACTUALLY GOING ON IS STALKING. IT'S IRRELEVANT THAT MR. SIMPSON AND HIS WIFE OR HIS FORMER WIFE HAPPENED TO FREQUENT THE SAME RESTAURANTS. IN FACT, THERE'S A VERY REASONABLE EXPLANATION FOR THAT.IF IN THE COURSE OF A 17-YEAR RELATIONSHIP PEOPLE HAVE A NUMBER OF FAVORITE RESTAURANTS, JUST THE FACT THAT THEY GET DIVORCED DOESN'T MEAN THAT ONE OF THEM HAS TO STOP GOING TO THEIR FAVORITE RESTAURANT. AND IT SHOULDN'T SURPRISE US AT ALL THAT THESE TWO PEOPLE HAPPENED TO ON OCCASION FIND THEMSELVES IN THE SAME RESTAURANT. AND SIMPLY TO INFER FROM THAT FACT ALONE, WHICH IS WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, THAT THAT'S SOME SORT OF STALKING ACTIVITY IS NOT AN INFERENCE THAT CAN BE JUSTIFIED BY THE EVIDENCE.SO WE'LL OBJECT NOT ONLY ON 403 GROUNDS, THAT THIS IS NOT STALKING ACTIVITY, BUT ON GROUNDS OF 1101 AND 352 AS WELL, THAT THIS ACTIVITY BEARS NO RELATIONSHIP OR NO SIMILARITY TO WHAT HAPPENED ON JUNE 12TH.THE ENDING OF THE RELATIONSHIP WITH MR. ZLOMSOWITCH IS RELEVANT ONLY IF THE RELATIONSHIP WITH MR. ZLOMSOWITCH BECOMES EVIDENCE IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND WITH RESPECT TO THAT INCIDENT, WE HAVE ARGUED THAT THE INFERENCE THEY WANT TO DRAW FROM IT IS JUST COUNTER TO WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.I MEAN THE FACT THAT MR. SIMPSON DIDN'T BARGE IN, DIDN'T INTERRUPT THEM, DID NOT CONFRONT THEM IN AN ANGRY MANNER SIMPLY UNDERCUTS ANY SUGGESTION THAT THIS IS A PRIOR SYMBOL OR INCIDENT THAT EXPLAINS WHAT HAPPENED ON THE NIGHT OF JUNE 12TH, 1994. IN FACT, IT MAKES THE SCENARIO THAT THE PEOPLE WANT TO PRESENT OF WHAT HAPPENED ON JUNE 12TH LESS LIKELY RATHER THAN MORE LIKELY.WITH RESPECT TO ITEM 27 -- AND THERE'S A RELATED ITEM, NUMBER 41. THESE ARE BOTH STATEMENTS ALLEGEDLY MADE BY MR. SIMPSON TO MRS. SIMPSON'S MOTHER, JUDITHA BROWN, REGARDING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HE AND HER DAUGHTER.AND I ASK THE COURT IN BOTH OF THESE INSTANCES TO LOOK AT THE PRECISE LANGUAGE PROFFERED BY THE PEOPLE OF WHAT WAS SAID.IN ITEM NUMBER 27, WHAT WAS SAID WAS, ""PEOPLE SAY I SHOULD STAY AWAY FROM HER, BUT I CAN'T. I LOVE HER. I LOVE HER. PEOPLE TELL ME TO LET HER GO, AND I CAN'T LET HER GO.""NOW, WHEN WE ASK, WELL, WHAT'S THE RELEVANCE OF THAT OTHER THAN SHOWING THAT IN THE COURSE OF A DIVORCE, MR. SIMPSON STILL LOVED HIS WIFE, THE RELEVANCE THE PEOPLE ASSERT IS TO CITE THIS CASE OF DE MOSS, PEOPLE VERSUS DE MOSS, IN WHICH THE STATEMENT ALLEGED WAS, ""IF I CAN'T HAVE HER, NOBODY CAN.""THAT'S A THREAT. SAYING, ""I LOVE HER. I CAN'T LET HER GO,"" IS NOT A THREAT, AND WE WOULD CONTEND THAT THESE STATEMENTS HAVE NO RELEVANCE IF THEY CANNOT BE CHARACTERIZED AS THREATS.ITEM NUMBER 41 -- EXCUSE ME.BETWEEN DEFENSE COUNSEL.)
","JANUARY 12, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
#MR. UELMEN: ,"THE STATEMENT INVOLVED IN ITEM NUMBER 27 WAS IN 1992 DURING THE PENDENCY OF THE DIVORCE. IT WASN'T EVEN CLOSE IN PROXIMITY TO THE EVENTS OF JUNE 12TH, 1994. SO IT WOULDN'T EVEN SHOW A STATE OF MIND THAT WOULD BE IN EXISTENCE TWO YEARS LATER. SO TO THAT EXTENT, IT IS IRRELEVANT, AND ITS PREJUDICIAL IMPACT OUTWEIGHS ITS PROBATIVE VALUE.AND THE SAME THING IS TRUE OF ITEM 41, EVEN THOUGH THIS IS CLOSER IN PROXIMITY. THIS IS MARCH OF 1994. THE STATEMENT IS, ""THE ONLY WOMAN I WANT IN MY LIFE AND I CAN'T HAVE IS YOUR DAUGHTER."" THAT'S NOT A THREAT AND IT BEARS NO RESEMBLANCE TO THE DE MOSS STATEMENT CITED AS AUTHORITY, ""IF I CAN'T HAVE HER, NOBODY ELSE WILL.""SO WE OBJECT SIMPLY ON GROUNDS OF IRRELEVANCE AND ON GROUNDS OF 352 AS WELL.

SIMPSON DID NOT HAVE A LEGITIMATE REASON TO BE VISITING THE PREMISES. ONLY AFTER THAT HAS BEEN DETERMINED WOULD THESE THEN BE ADMISSIBLE. BUT WE WOULD MAINTAIN THEY SHOULD BE EXCLUDED UNDER 1101 BECAUSE THEY BEAR NO SIMILARITY TO WHAT HAPPENED ON JUNE 12, 1994, AND ON THE GROUNDS OF 352.ITEMS 33 AND 34, AGAIN, WE RESTATE OUR HEARSAY OBJECTION. THE ONLY EXCEPTION ASSERTED IS 1250 OF THE EVIDENCE CODE.

THE FACT THAT THE PARTIES HAVE AN ARGUMENT ABOUT WHOSE PICTURES ARE IN THE FAMILY ALBUM AND THAT ARGUMENT RESULTS IN A BROKEN DOOR SIMPLY DOESN'T PROVIDE ANY EVIDENCE OF PROBATIVE VALUE TO EXPLAIN THE INTENT OR THE MOTIVE OR THE IDENTITY OF THE PERPETRATOR OF THE JUNE 12TH INCIDENT.AND AGAIN, I UNDERLINE THAT IDENTITY IS THE REAL ISSUE IN CONTENTION HERE. THERE ARE NO SIGNATURE FACTS HERE THAT WOULD JUSTIFY USING THIS TO PROVE THE IDENTITY OF THE PERPETRATOR OF THE MURDER ON JUNE 12TH.ITEM 38, THE FACT THAT MISS SIMPSON MOVED TO THE BUNDY ADDRESS, THERE WILL BE NO ARGUMENT ABOUT THAT.ITEM 40, WE ASSERT A HEARSAY EXCEPTION, AGAIN, 1250, THE ONLY EXCEPTION RELIED UPON. THIS IS SIMPLY A STATEMENT BY THE VICTIM WHICH CANNOT BE CROSS-EXAMINED, AND HER STATE OF MIND AND CONDUCT AT THE TIME THIS STATEMENT WAS MADE IS TOTALLY IRRELEVANT TO ANY ISSUES IN THIS CASE.ITEM 41 I HAVE ALSO ADDRESSED.ITEM 42, WE'LL RAISE A SUBSTANTIAL 403 QUESTION IN TERMS OF WHETHER THESE STATEMENTS WERE ACTUALLY MADE. AND IF THEY WERE MADE, THEIR RELEVANCY REMAINS IN QUESTION, AND WE WILL OBJECT TO THEM AS IRRELEVANT.ITEM 47, SIMPLY THE FACT THAT THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT AT RECONCILIATION WILL NOT BE CONTESTED IN THIS CASE.ITEM 48, AGAIN, WE OBJECT ON THE GROUNDS OF HEARSAY. WE BELIEVE THE ONLY EVIDENCE THAT CAN BE PRESENTED OF THIS TRANSACTION IS A STATEMENT OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, WHICH CANNOT BE CROSS-EXAMINED AND THERE'S NO HEARSAY OBJECTION EVEN ASSERTED HERE.THE IRS LETTER, AGAIN, WE SIMPLY OBJECT TO THAT AS IRRELEVANT. IT DOES NOT EXPLAIN ANY CONDUCT IN THIS CASE. AND WE INVITE THE COURT TO LOOK AT THAT LETTER AND SEE THAT IT DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY THREATS OR ANY ATTEMPT TO COERCE MRS. SIMPSON.ITEMS 52 AND 53, AGAIN, SIMPLE HEARSAY OBJECTIONS, AGAIN 1250 BEING THE ONLY EXCEPTION RELIED UPON AND, AGAIN, THE STATE OF MIND AND THE CONDUCT OF THE VICTIM WILL NOT BE IN QUESTION.THE DANCE RECITAL, THERE WON'T BE ANY ISSUE ABOUT THAT.AS TO THE MURDER ITSELF, THE ONLY ISSUE AS I MENTIONED WILL BE THE ISSUE OF IDENTITY OF WHO DID IT.THE ASHTON STREET INCIDENT THAT WAS ADDED, WE HAVE A 403 OBJECTION AS TO WHAT, IF ANYTHING, THIS PROVES IF THE WITNESSES ARE NOT ABLE TO IDENTIFY THIS AS AN ACTUAL ALTERCATION BETWEEN MR. SIMPSON AND HIS WIFE SINCE THEY ARE SIMPLY RELYING ON WHAT THEY HEARD THROUGH A BEDROOM WALL.WE HAVE A 403 PROBLEM EVEN BEFORE WE GET TO THE 1101 EXCEPTION, AND WE WILL OBJECT ON THE GROUNDS THAT THERE IS NO SIMILARITY UNDER 1101. AND THE 352 OBJECTION HERE I THINK IS PARTICULARLY STRONG BECAUSE OF THE REMOTENESS OF THIS INCIDENT. WE ARE TALKING HERE ABOUT AN INCIDENT THAT IS 17 YEARS OLD.THE VICTORIA BEACH INCIDENT, AGAIN, THE 403 ISSUE OF WHETHER THIS WITNESS CAN ACTUALLY IDENTIFY THE PARTICIPANTS IN THIS TRANSACTION NINE YEARS AFTER IT HAPPENED WILL BE IN ISSUE. AND ASSUMING WE GET OVER THAT, WE WILL RAISE AN 1101 OBJECTION AND A 352 OBJECTION.AND THEN FINALLY, WITH RESPECT TO THE SOJOURN CONTACT, WE HAVE A HEARSAY OBJECTION AND CONTEND THAT THE ONLY EXCEPTION RELIED UPON 1250 GETS US NOWHERE BECAUSE THE STATE OF MIND AND THE CONDUCT OF THE VICTIM ARE NOT GOING TO BE IN ISSUE.I WOULD JUST LIKE TO CONFER WITH COUNSEL.

DARDEN WILL BE ADDRESSING A SPECIFIC AREA WHICH HE WANTS TO TALK TO THE COURT ABOUT FOR A FEW MINUTES AFTER I CONCLUDE MY REMARKS.NOW, YOUR HONOR, EARLY ON IN THIS CASE THE DEFENSE PLANTED THE IDEA, THE WISH, FRANKLY, THAT A DETECTIVE WITH THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT PLANTED EVIDENCE, THE GLOVE AT ROCKINGHAM.NOW, THAT OF COURSE IS AN INFLAMMATORY ACCUSATION, THAT A POLICE DETECTIVE WOULD PLANT A GLOVE, AND IT MADE HOT NEWS AND THE DEFENSE, IN MONTHS GONE PASSED, ALTHOUGH NOT RECENTLY IN MONTHS GONE PASSED, THEY REITERATED AND REINFORCED THIS NOTION, THIS IDEA, THIS WISH OF THEIRS REPEATEDLY WITHIN THE MEDIA, SO IT HAS ALREADY CAUSED A GREAT DEAL OF TURMOIL TO THE DETECTIVE INVOLVED.NOW, THE TROUBLE WITH THIS WISH, AND I'M NOT CALLING IT A THEORY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T EVEN RISE TO THE LEVEL OF A THEORY, THE TROUBLE WITH THIS WISH, THIS DREAM OF THE DEFENSE TEAM, IS THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT THEORY.MOREOVER, ALL OF THE EVIDENCE KNOWN TO THE PROSECUTION REFUTES ANY SUCH THEORY.YOUR HONOR, IN THE -- I WANT TO ADDRESS ONE POINT AND THEN QUICKLY MOVE ON.IN THE DEFENSE RESPONSE BRIEF THE DEFENSE MAKES THE WILD ACCUSATION, PLANTS THE IDEA IN THE COURT'S MIND PERHAPS THAT THE IDENTIFICATION OF CERTAIN OFFICERS WHO ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE PRIOR TO DETECTIVE FUHRMAN'S ARRIVAL, WELL KNOWN ONLY TO, QUOTE, GOD AND THE PROSECUTION, CLOSE QUOTE, AND THAT WAS SIMPLY INFLAMMATORY RHETORIC.IN FACT, THE IDENTIFICATION OF THOSE OFFICERS, THEIR NAMES, AS WELL AS THE TIMES OF THEIR ARRIVALS AT THE CRIME SCENE AT BUNDY, AS WELL AS THE TIMES AND NAMES AND ARRIVAL TIMES AND NAMES OF THE FOUR DETECTIVES, INCLUDING DETECTIVE FUHRMAN, ARE ALL RECORDED ON THE CRIME SCENE LOG WHICH WAS DISCOVERY NUMBER 00038 PROVIDED TO THE DEFENSE AT THE INCEPTION OF THE CASE, SO THE DEFENSE HAS KNOWN FOR MONTHS THE IDENTITY OF NOT ONLY THE FIVE OFFICERS I PARTICULARLY REFER TO IN OUR BRIEF, BUT THE OTHER OFFICERS, AND THERE WERE OTHE ARRIVED PRIOR TO DETECTIVE FUHRMAN'S ARRIVAL AS WELL.NOW, THAT IS JUST THE SORT OF INFLAMMATORY RHETORIC AND ANALYZATION AGAINST THE PROSECUTION THAT THE DEFENSE HAS DONE, FRANKLY, WITH REGARD TO THE ISSUE ON WHETHER THIS POLICE DETECTIVE PLANTED THIS GLOVE AT ROCKINGHAM.NOW, YOUR HONOR, BECAUSE THE THRUST OF OUR MOTION BASICALLY IS GOING TO BE UNDER SECTION 352, AND OF COURSE THE COURT HAS TO DO A WEIGHING PROCESS IN EVALUATING THE EVIDENCE, THE COURT NEEDS THE CONTEXT TO EVALUATE THAT EVIDENCE.I WANT TO RECAP THE EVIDENCE INSOFAR AS IT RELATES TO DETECTIVE FUHRMAN'S RECOVERY OF THE GLOVE AND AS -- INSOFAR AS IT RELATES TO THE THREE AREAS UNDERLYING THIS MOTION WE ARE BRINGING TODAY.AND THAT EVIDENCE STARTS BASICALLY WITH KATO KAELIN WHO AS WE ALL KNOW BY THIS TIME WAS A FRIEND OF THE DEFENDANT'S LIVING RENT FREE IN THE DEFENDANT'S -- ONE OF THE DEFENDANT'S THREE GUEST HOUSES AT ROCKINGHAM.AND WE KNOW THAT LATER IN THE EVENING, AT APPROXIMATELY 10:10 IN THE EVENING ON JUNE 12, KATO KAELIN, AFTER HAVING GOTTEN FOOD MUCH EARLIER IN THE EVENING WITH THE DEFENDANT, WAS BACK IN HIS ROOM AND HE WAS TALKING ON THE PHONE WITH A FRIEND NAMED RACHEL FERRARA.THEY HAD TALKED ON THE PHONE FOR PERHAPS A HALF AN HOUR WHEN KATO SUDDENLY HEARD, KNOCK, KNOCK KNOCK, (MS. LEWIS POUNDING ON PODIUM), THAT KIND OF THUMPING NOISES AND FELT SOMETHING AS A VIBRATION OR MOVEMENT SIGNIFICANT WITH IT.IN FACT, IT WAS SUCH A STRONG FEELING THAT IT CAUSED THE WALL TO SHAKE TO THE POINT OF MOVING A PICTURE THAT WAS ON THE WALL TO ALMOST COME OFF THE WALL AND THIS IS THE WALL OF THE GUEST HOUSE WHERE KATO RESIDES.NOW, ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT WALL THERE IS A PATH THAT IS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE WALL. NOW, ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT PATH IS A CHAINLINK FENCE WHICH SURROUNDS BASICALLY THE PERIMETER OF THE PROPERTY.SO KATO WAS CONCERNED AND STARTLED BY THIS EVENT. HE ASKED HIS FRIEND RACHEL WHETHER THERE HAD BEEN AN EARTHQUAKE. SHE INDICATED THAT SHE HADN'T FELT ANYTHING, SO HE SPOKE WITH RACHEL FOR A COUPLE OF MORE MINUTES, GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH HER AND WENT OUT TO INVESTIGATE. HE WENT OUTSIDE WITH A FLASHLIGHT THAT HE HAD.NOW, MEANTIME, WHEN THAT WAS HAPPENING, A LIMOUSINE DRIVER NAMED ALLAN PARK HAD PULLED UP A LIMOUSINE TO THE GATE, TO THE ASHFORD GATE AT THE DEFENDANT'S ROCKINGHAM RESIDENCE, BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY ARRANGED THAT THAT LIMOUSINE DRIVER WOULD PICK UP THE DEFENDANT AND TAKE HIM TO THE AIRPORT, AND THE LIMOUSINE DRIVER HAD BEEN THERE AT THE GATE FOR SOME TIME RINGING THE BUZZER, THE INTERCOM SYSTEM WHICH RINGS INTO THE MAIN HOUSE, BECAUSE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO PICK UP THE DEFENDANT.NOW, THERE HAD BEEN NO RESPONSE. MR. PARK SAW THAT THERE WAS NO LIGHT THAT HE COULD SEE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE HOUSE. HE SAW ONE LIGHT ON I BELIEVE AT THE UPSTAIRS PORTION OF THE HOUSE, BUT HE HAD BECOME CONCERNED BECAUSE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PICKING UP THE DEFENDANT TO TAKE HIM TO THE AIRPORT, YET NO ONE WAS HOME.SO ALLAN PARK CALLED HIS BOSS TO GET INSTRUCTIONS AND HIS BOSS BASICALLY SAID WAIT FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME LONGER AND THEN LEAVE IF HE DOESN'T SHOW UP.WELL, SHORTLY THEREAFTER, JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES AFTER ALLAN PARK TALKED TO HIS BOSS ON THE TELEPHONE THAT WAS IN THE LIMOUSINE THAT HE WAS DRIVING, HE LOOKED INTO THE ROCKINGHAM ESTATE AND HE SAW TWO IMPORTANT THINGS:HE SAW KATO KAELIN COMING OUT OF THE GUEST HOUSE WITH A FLASHLIGHT. HE ALSO, IN A DIFFERENT VICINITY, SAW A SIX-FOOT TALL 200-POUND AFRICAN AMERICAN WALK QUICKLY TOWARD THE MAIN DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND GO INTO THE HOUSE.AND AS AN ASIDE, WE KNOW FROM THE TESTIMONY OF KATO KAELIN THAT THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO HAD KEYS TO THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE WERE THE DEFENDANT, HIS DAUGHTER, ARNELLE SIMPSON, AND THE MAID.NOW, WHEN MR. PARK SAW THE 200-POUND SIX-FOOT AFRICAN AMERICAN PERSON ENTER THE HOUSE, HE CONTINUED TO RING THE INTERCOM, AND WITHIN APPROXIMATELY TWENTY TO THIRTY SECONDS LONGER OF RINGING THE INTERCOM THE DEFENDANT ANSWERED THE TELEPHONE, THE TELEPHONE LEADING TO THE INTERCOM AT THE GATE.THE DEFENDANT SAID HE HAD OVERSLEPT. CLEARLY HE HAD JUST ENTERED THE HOUSE.NOW, KATO STARTED AN ATTEMPT TO INVESTIGATE THE NOISE THAT HE HEARD; HOWEVER, MR. SIMPSON WAS EAGER, THE DEFENDANT WAS EAGER TO GET TO THE AIRPORT BECAUSE HIS FLIGHT WAS GOING TO BE LEAVING SHORTLY, AND CONSEQUENTLY, KATO, WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE LIMOUSINE DRIVER, ALLAN PARK, AND THE DEFENDANT LOADED THE DEFENDANT'S BAGS INTO THE LIMOUSINE AND EVENTUALLY LEFT.AT THAT POINT KATO WENT BACK INTO THE GUEST HOUSE. HE WAS ALONE ON THE ESTATE WITH A SMALL FLASHLIGHT. THE NOISE HAD SCARED AND ALARMED HIM, BUT THE PATHWAY WHICH I MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO BEHIND HIS GUEST HOUSE IS OVERGROWN WITH BUSHES AND THIS WAS AT NIGHTTIME AND IT WAS DARK SO HE DIDN'T WANT TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER ON HIS OWN.NOW, AS WE KNOW, AT APPROXIMATELY MIDNIGHT THAT NIGHT ON JUNE 12 OR THE WEE MORNING HOURS OF JUNE 13, THE BODIES OF THE VICTIMS, NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON AND RONALD GOLDMAN WERE DISCOVERED AT NICOLE'S RESIDENCE ON BUNDY.THOSE BODIES, AS THE COURT WILL RECALL, WERE DISCOVERED BY A NEIGHBOR WHO WENT, IN ESSENCE, SEARCHING FOR THE OWNER OF THE BLOODY-PAWED AKITA THAT THE COURT HAS I BELIEVE HEARD ABOUT BEFORE.NOW, ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, WITHIN A FEW MINUTES AFTER THE DISCOVERY OF THE BODIES, THE POLICE WERE NOTIFIED AND THE POLICE OF COURSE RESPONDED IMMEDIATELY.NOW, THERE WERE SEVERAL OFFICERS WHO WERE FIRST ON THE SCENE. AMONG THEM WERE WITH OFFICER ZEIGLER, OFFICER GLORIOSO, THERE WAS A SERGEANT THERE, A PATROL SERGEANT THERE, AND THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER OTHERS, ALL OF THESE KNOWN TO THE DEFENSE MANY MONTHS AGO.THEY ALL ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE FIRST. A COUPLE OF THEM LEFT TO GO DOOR KNOCKING RESIDENCES. OTHERS STAYED TO MAINTAIN THE SECURITY AND THE PERIMETER OF THE CRIME SCENE SINCE IT WAS A DOUBLE HOMICIDE.DETECTIVE RON PHILLIPS OF WEST L.A. DIVISION WAS THE FIRST DETECTIVE TO BE NOTIFIED AND HE WAS ASSIGNED THE CASE. HE TELEPHONED DETECTIVE MARK FUHRMAN TO TELL HIM ABOUT THE HOMICIDE AND DETECTIVE FUHRMAN WAS INITIALLY ASSIGNED WITH DETECTIVE PHILLIPS TO THE CASE.DETECTIVE PHILLIPS AND DETECTIVE FUHRMAN DECIDED TO GET TOGETHER AT WEST L.A. STATION TO PICK UP THE APPROPRIATE DETECTIVE CAR AND THEN DROVE OUT TOGETHER TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. THEY ARRIVED AT THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE AT APPROXIMATELY 2:05, SOMEWHERE IN THE VICINITY OF TWO HOURS AFTER THE DISCOVERY OF THESE BODIES, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR PURPOSES OF THIS MOTION, AFTER THE PRESENCE OF NUMEROUS POLICE OFFICERS AND A POLICE SERGEANT AT THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE.NOW, WHEN DETECTIVE FUHRMAN ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE HE SAW WHAT THE OTHER OFFICERS WHO WERE THERE HAD SEEN AND WHAT DETECTIVE PHILLIPS SAW, AND THAT IS A FEW ITEMS AT THE FEET OF RONALD GOLDMAN.AND YOUR HONOR, I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS CRIME SCENE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WHERE BOTH OF THE VICTIMS' BODIES LAY IS A VERY SMALL AREA. THIS IS NOT -- THESE MURDERS TOOK PLACE IN A VERY SMALL LOCATION. AND I THINK THE COURT EVENTUALLY WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DETERMINE THAT, BUT I DO WANT TO MAKE THAT REPRESENTATION FOR THIS HEARING, THAT IT WAS A VERY SMALL AREA, SURPRISINGLY SMALL.NOW, AT THE FEET OF RONALD GOLDMAN DETECTIVE FUHRMAN SAW, AS WELL AS OTHER OFFICERS WHO HAD PRECEDED HIS ARRIVAL, A LEFT-HANDED BULKY MAN'S GLOVE. THEY ALSO SAW A WHITE ENVELOPE WHICH CONTAINED THE GLASSES WHICH MR. GOLDMAN WAS DROPPING OFF THERE AT NICOLE'S RESIDENCE. THEY ALSO SAW THE DARK WATCH CAP, BUT IN PARTICULAR THEY SAW, FOR PURPOSES OF THIS MOTION, THEY SAW THE LEFT-HANDED BULKY MAN'S GLOVE THERE AT THE FEET OF RONALD GOLDMAN.THEY ALSO SAW AND DETECTIVE FUHRMAN ALSO SAW BLOODY SHOEPRINTS LEADING AWAY FROM THIS SMALL AREA WHERE BOTH THE BODIES LAY AND OF COURSE HE TOOK NOTE OF THOSE.NOW, RELATIVELY SHORTLY AFTER THE ARRIVAL THOSE TWO DETECTIVES, THEY LEARNED THAT ROBBERY/HOMICIDE DIVISION OF THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT WOULD BE INDEED TAKING OVER THE CASE, AND AS THE COURT IS AWARE, BUT I'M NOT SURE OTHERS ARE SO AWARE, ROBBERY/HOMICIDE IS REALLY A MISNOMER BECAUSE THAT DIVISION OF LAPD HANDLES A VARIETY OF COMPLEX OR HIGH-PROFILE CASES. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO REALLY WITH HOMICIDES THAT ARE COMMITTED DURING THE COURSE OF A ROBBERY. THAT IS NOT THE THRUST OF THE UNIT. SO THEY ARE NOTIFIED THAT ROBBERY/HOMICIDE WOULD BE TAKING OVER THE CASE.AND WHAT THEY DID, WHAT MARK FUHRMAN IN PARTICULAR DID WAS TO WAIT THERE WITH DETECTIVE PHILLIPS. HE ALSO SPOKE, WHILE HE WAS THERE, TO A DETECTIVE LIEUTENANT SPANGLER AND THEY TALKED ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE SEEING AND WAITED FOR THE ARRIVAL OF DETECTIVES VANNATTER AND LANGE WHO WERE THE INVESTIGATING OFFICERS WHO TOOK OVER THE CASE. ONE OF THEM ARRIVED AT 4:00 A.M. AND THE OTHER AT APPROXIMATELY 4:30 A.M.BY THE WAY, YOUR HONOR, DURING THE ENTIRE TIME THAT MARK FUHRMAN WAS AT THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE HE WAS WEARING STANDARD DETECTIVE ATTIRE. HE WAS WEARING A SPORT COAT AND SLACKS. IT WAS A JUNE NIGHT HERE IN LOS ANGELES AND HE HAD NO OVERCOAT ON, NO TRENCH COAT ON, NOTHING THAT COULD CONCEAL A BULKY ITEM.AFTER DETECTIVES VANNATTER AND LANGE ARRIVED, ALL FOUR OF THE DETECTIVES PROCEEDED IN TWO CARS OVER TO ROCKINGHAM.AS THE COURT IS WELL AWARE, THEY EVENTUALLY MADE ENTRY ONTO THE GROUNDS OF ROCKINGHAM AND THE FIRST PERSON THEY CONTACTED THERE WAS KATO WHO WAS BACK IN HIS GUEST ROOM APPARENTLY ASLEEP. THEY COULD SEE HIM THROUGH THE BLINDS.THEY KNOCKED ON HIS DOOR AND INQUIRED ABOUT THE DEFENDANT'S WHEREABOUTS. KATO DIRECTED THEM UP TO A COUPLE OF GUEST HOUSES BEYOND, THAT IS TO THE QUARTERS OR THE RESIDENCE, I SHOULD SAY, WHERE ARNELLE SIMPSON WAS STAYING.NOW, AT THAT POINT IN TIME, BECAUSE ROBBERY/HOMICIDE DIVISION HAD TAKEN OVER THE CASE, THE INVESTIGATING OFFICERS IN THE CASE WERE DETECTIVES LANGE AND VANNATTER. IN ADDITION, DETECTIVE PHILLIPS IS A SENIOR DETECTIVE TO DETECTIVE MARK FUHRMAN, SO THOSE THREE SENIOR OFFICERS, THE TWO INVESTIGATING OFFICERS AND THE SENIOR OFFICER BETWEEN DETECTIVE FUHRMAN AND DETECTIVE PHILLIPS, PROCEEDED ON FOR THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THEY WERE THERE AND THAT IS TO IDENTIFY THE LOCATION OF THE DEFENDANT.NOW, BECAUSE THEY DID NOT KNOW WHO KATO KAELIN WAS AND BECAUSE THEY HAD JUST LEFT THE SCENE OF THIS VICIOUS, BRUTAL, BLOODY, DOUBLE MURDER, 2.1, I BELIEVE IT IS, MILES AWAY AT BUNDY, DETECTIVE FUHRMAN REMAINED IN KATO'S ROOM TO SPEAK WITH HIM A LITTLE BIT TO GET A FEEL FOR WHETHER THIS PERSON WAS AN OKAY PERSON WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE, WHAT WAS GOING ON.SO HE DID. HE HAD A CONVERSATION WITH KATO KAELIN, AND DURING THAT TIME DETECTIVE FUHRMAN NOTICED A PILE OF CLOTHING ON THE FLOOR IN KATO'S ROOM.HE ASKED KATO WHETHER THAT WAS THE CLOTHING, INCLUDING A PAIR OF SHOES THAT WAS THERE, THAT KATO HAD WORN THE NIGHT BEFORE AND KATO CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS.DETECTIVE FUHRMAN ASKED KATO IF HE COULD LOOK AT THE CLOTHING AND KATO SAID SURE. DETECTIVE FUHRMAN PICKED UP THE SHOES, IN PARTICULAR, AND LOOKED AT THEIR SOLES. THEY WEREN'T BLOODY AND THE FOOTPRINTS DIDN'T APPEAR TO MATCH THE FOOTPRINTS HE HAD SEEN AT THE CRIME SCENE.NOW, DURING THE COURSE OF THAT CONVERSATION DETECTIVE FUHRMAN ASKED KATO IF HE HAD EXPERIENCED ANYTHING UNUSUAL THE NIGHT BEFORE. KATO SAID, YES, AT THE APPROXIMATE TIME I MENTIONED EARLIER, HE HEARD THIS STRANGE THUMPING ON THE WALL TO HIS GUEST HOUSE AND HE SAW THE PICTURE MOVE ALMOST OFF THE WALL AND HE THOUGHT IT WAS AN EARTHQUAKE BUT IT HADN'T BEEN.

NONE OF THESE FACTS WHICH I HAVE JUST MENTIONED TO THE COURT, NOR ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO MENTION, ARE A SURPRISE TO ANYONE. THERE IS NO MYSTERY TO THESE, AS THE DEFENSE PROCLAIMED THERE WAS IN THEIR RESPONSE BRIEF.NOW, DURING THE COURSE OF THIS CONVERSATION, AS I MENTIONED, THAT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN WAS HAVING WITH KATO, KATO ALERTED HIM TO THIS EARTHQUAKE-LIKE SOUND AND TOLD HIM THE DIRECTION THAT IT WAS COMING FROM, SO DETECTIVE FUHRMAN, LIKE ANY GOOD, CONSCIENTIOUS POLICE OFFICER IN ANY TOWN IN THIS COUNTRY SHOULD DO, DID WHAT HE SHOULD DO AND THAT WAS TO GO AND INVESTIGATE THAT SOUND, THAT NOISE, THAT VIBRATION THAT KATO HAD HEARD.SO HE WENT TO THE AREA BEHIND KATO'S GUEST HOUSE, AND ALTHOUGH HE HAD ONLY A SMALL FLASHLIGHT THERE, HE COULD SEE SOMEWHAT. IT WAS DARK AND OVERGROWN. HE WALKED DOWN THE PATHWAY, AND AT A POINT DOWN THE PATHWAY HIS HEART STARTED TO POUND AND IT STARTED TO POUND BECAUSE HE SAW WHAT HE REALIZED WAS PROBABLY THE RIGHT-HANDED MATE TO THE BULKY MEN'S LEATHER GLOVE THAT HE HAD SEEN AT THE CRIME SCENE AT BUNDY A SHORT TIME BEFORE ONLY TWO MILES AWAY.AT THAT POINT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN RETURNED TO THE OTHER DETECTIVES AND ALERTED THEM TO WHAT HE HAD FOUND AND TOOK EACH OF THE DETECTIVES IN TURN OUT TO SEE THE GLOVE FOR THEMSELVES.THE GLOVE EVENTUALLY WAS COLLECTED BY A CRIMINALIST, DENNIS FUNG, AND OF COURSE TAKEN INTO THE CUSTODY OF THE EVIDENCE -- THE PROPERTY DEPARTMENT AT LAPD.NOW, THIS NOTION OF THE DEFENSE THAT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN COULD HAVE SOMEHOW PLANTED THIS GLOVE, AS I INDICATED EARLIER, IS TOTALLY REFUTED BY ALL OF THE EVIDENCE. THE TIMING, AS THE COURT MADE INQUIRY WITH REGARD TO, THE TIMING OF THE LIMOUSINE -- FIRST KATO HEARING THIS THUMPING NOISE RIGHT AGAINST HIS WALL, OF GOING OUT TO INVESTIGATE WITH A FLASHLIGHT JUST A FEW MINUTES LATER, OF THE LIMOUSINE DRIVER, ALLAN PARK, SEEING HIM COME OUT AT THAT TIME AND SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THAT SEEING WHO WAS CLEARLY THE DEFENDANT GOING INTO THE FRONT OF HIS HOUSE, ALL OF THAT EVIDENCE CLEARLY DIRECTS ITSELF TO THE FACT THAT THE DEFENDANT DROPPED THAT GLOVE BEHIND KATO KAELIN'S GUEST HOUSE.THE DEFENSE THEORY THAT IT WAS PLANTED FAILS TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT EARTHQUAKE LIKE THUMPING AND THAT NOISE.

","JANUARY 13, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
#MS. LEWIS: ,"WELL, I WILL SAY TO THE COURT, AND I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY DISPUTE, THAT THAT -- THE NOISE WAS CAUSED BY THE DEFENDANT THERE DROPPING THE GLOVE, AND I THINK THAT IS THE OBVIOUS INFERENCE FROM ALL OF THIS EVIDENCE AND I THINK I MENTIONED THAT ALREADY, AND THAT IS, THAT THE DEFENDANT INDEED HIMSELF DROPPED THE GLOVE AS HE WAS TRYING TO SECRETLY COME BACK ON TO HIS PROPERTY SO THAT NOBODY WOULD SEE HIM ENTERING.SINCE HE LATER LIED AND SAID HE HAD BEEN SLEEPING, THAT WOULD BE INCONSISTENT WITH SOMEBODY SEEING HIM ENTERING. AS IT HAPPENS, ALLAN PARK DID SEE HIM ENTER, SO THAT ATTEMPTED EFFORT OF HIS TO SUPPRESS HIS ENTRY DIDN'T WORK.NOW, WITH REGARD TO THE MOTION AT HAND, YOUR HONOR, THAT IS ONE POINT TO BE MADE, THAT THE TIMING, ALL OF THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE DEFENDANT INDEED BEING THE PERSON WHO DROPPED THE GLOVE BACK THERE AND IS INCONSISTENT AND HAS NO EVIDENTIARY BASIS FOR SUPPORTING DETECTIVE FUHRMAN HAVING -- PLACING THE GLOVE BACK THERE.IN ADDITION, YOUR HONOR, THERE IS THE OBVIOUS -- THE OBVIOUS THING TO NOTE, AND THAT IS THAT THE NUMEROUS OTHER OFFICERS THERE AT THE CRIME SCENE, INCLUDING THE POLICE SERGEANT, DID NOT SEE A SECOND GLOVE ANYWHERE AT THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. THEY SAW A LONE GLOVE, A SINGLE GLOVE AT THE FEET OF RONALD GOLDMAN.A THIRD POINT IN THIS REGARD, YOUR HONOR, IS THAT THE OFFICERS AND THE SERGEANT AND THE OTHER DETECTIVES, INCLUDING DETECTIVE FUHRMAN, HIS PARTNER, ALL -- EXCUSE ME -- INCLUDING DETECTIVE PHILLIPS, DETECTIVE FUHRMAN'S PARTNER, ALL SAW DETECTIVE FUHRMAN WHEN DETECTIVE FUHRMAN WAS AT THE CRIME SCENE.HE WASN'T THE INVISIBLE MAN, ABLE TO GO ABOUT AND LOOK AND FIND THINGS ON HIS OWN. HE WAS PRESENT. WHEN HE WAS PRESENT THERE WERE NUMEROUS OTHER OFFICERS PRESENT THERE AS WELL, SO THE DEFENSE THEORY PRESUPPOSES THAT HE WAS SOMEHOW ABLE TO REMOVE EVIDENCE WHICH NONE OF THESE OTHER OFFICERS WHO HAD BEEN THERE, SOME OF THEM FOR TWO HOURS BEFORE DETECTIVE FUHRMAN ARRIVED, WERE ABLE TO SEE.A FOURTH POINT IN THIS REGARD, AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, YOUR HONOR, IS THAT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN WAS WEARING NO CLOTHING WHICH WOULD SUPPORT BEING CAPABLE OF CARRYING AWAY UNNOTICED A BULKY MAN'S GLOVE SUCH AS THE ONE THAT WAS FOUND AT ROCKINGHAM.AN ADDITIONAL POINT TO BE MADE IN THIS REGARD, YOUR HONOR, IS THAT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN'S LOOKING, SCRUTINIZING THE SOLES OF THE SHOES OF KATO KAELIN TO SEE IF THEY APPEARED -- IF THEY WERE BLOODY OR IF THEY APPEARED TO MATCH THE BLOODY FOOTPRINT AT THE CRIME SCENE, THAT IS INCONSISTENT WITH A PREORDAINED PLAN OR IDEA OR EFFORT OF DETECTIVE FUHRMAN TO SOMEHOW PLANT EVIDENCE AGAINST THE DEFENDANT. THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH A DETECTIVE WHO IS SEARCHING FOR THE TRUTH AND INDEED THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN WAS DOING.THIS NOTION OR THIS WISH OF THE DEFENSE ALSO DOES NOT ADDRESS THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE IN THE CASE, AND OF COURSE I'M NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE DNA RESULT NOW, BUT IT SEEMS TO ACCOUNT FOR THOSE RESULTS AND FOR THE REMAINING SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE IN THE CASE, ALL OF WHICH WE ALSO BELIEVE POINTS TO THE DEFENDANT AS THE PERPETRATOR.ANOTHER POINT TO MAKE IN THIS REGARD, YOUR HONOR, IS THAT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN NEVER LEFT THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE UNTIL HE WAS IN THE COMPANY AGAIN OF DETECTIVE PHILLIPS AND IN THE OTHER CAR, DETECTIVES VANNATTER AND LANGE. THERE WAS NO OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM TO TAKE THE GLOVE OVER TO ROCKINGHAM. HE WAS PRESENT AT BUNDY AND STAYED THERE AND THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER OFFICERS THERE WHO ALL SAW HIM THERE UNTIL THE OTHER DETECTIVES ARRIVED AND THEY WENT OVER TOGETHER AND HE WAS IN THEIR PRESENCE AND IN THEIR COMPANY WHEN THEY ALL WENT ON TO THE ROCKINGHAM ESTATE AND APPROACHED KATO'S ROOM AND SO FORTH.FINALLY, YOUR HONOR, TO ACCEPT THIS WISH OR THIS DREAM OF THE DEFENSE THAT THE DETECTIVE PLANTED EVIDENCE, ONE WOULD HAVE TO ASSUME THAT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN WOULD BELIEVE THAT NONE OF THESE OTHER OFFICERS OR THE POLICE SERGEANT OR THE DETECTIVES HAS SEEN A SUPPOSED SECOND GLOVE THERE AT BUNDY. HE WOULD HAVE TO BELIEVE IN HIS OWN MIND THAT NONE OF THESE OTHER OFFICERS HAD SEEN THAT.SO IN ADDITION TO THERE BEING SIMPLY NO EVIDENCE OF DETECTIVE FUHRMAN'S HAVING REMOVED ANYTHING FROM THE CRIME SCENE, ALL OF THE INDICATIONS AND ALL OF THE EVIDENCE IS TO THE CONTRARY AND REALLY CONCLUSIVELY REFUTES THAT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN COULD HAVE POSSIBLY, HAD HE SO DESIRED, REMOVED ANYTHING, ESPECIALLY SOMETHING SO BULKY AS A GLOVE FROM THE CRIME SCENE.NOW, IN THIS REGARD, YOUR HONOR, THERE IS A BODY OF CASE LAW REGARDING WHAT WE REFER TO AS THIRD PARTY CULPABILITY WHICH IS DIRECTLY ANALOGOUS TO THE SITUATION WE HAVE HERE. THAT CASE LAW ADDRESSES WHEN ONE CAN PUT ON EVIDENCE OF SOMEONE OTHER THAN THE DEFENDANT COMMITTING THE CRIME.NOW, HERE THE DEFENSE HAS NOT GONE SO FAR AS TO ACCUSE DETECTIVE FUHRMAN OF COMMITTING THESE MURDERS. THEY HAVE, HOWEVER, ACCUSED HIM OF ATTRIBUTING TO THE DEFENDANT'S POSSESSION HIGHLY INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE AND THE DEFENDANT'S CONSTRUCTIVE POSSESSION, SINCE IT WAS FOUND ON HIS PROPERTY, RATHER THAN ON HIS PERSON, BUT THEY HAVE ACCUSED HIM OF DOING SOMETHING THAT IS HIGHLY INCRIMINATING TO THE DEFENDANT.IN THOSE CASES REGARDING THIRD PARTY CULPABILITY, THE SUPREME COURT BACK IN HALL IN 1986, AND IN ALL OF THE SUBSEQUENT CASES SINCE HALL, INCLUDING SEVERAL CASES THROUGHOUT THE 1990'S, AND IN THESE CASE -- CASES WERE DEATH PENALTY CASES WHERE THE SUPREME COURT AFFIRMED THE PENALTY OF DEATH.IN THESE CASES THEY ALL HELD THAT THE TRIAL COURT IN EACH OF THOSE INSTANCES POSSIBLY EXCLUDED FROM EVIDENCE, EVIDENCE OF MERE MOTIVE OR OPPORTUNITY TO COMMIT THE CRIME ON A THIRD PARTY.WHAT MAKES THAT DIRECTLY ANALOGOUS IN THIS INSTANCE, YOUR HONOR, IS THAT THAT WOULD BE THE MOST CRITICAL SITUATION WHERE IF THE APPELLATE COURTS FELT IT APPROPRIATE TO ALLOW IN EVIDENCE OF MOTIVE OF A THIRD PERSON, IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE IN THE AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MURDERS THEMSELVES AND OF COURSE THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF THAT IS NO MORE, UMM, HIGHLIGHTED THAN IT IS IN A DEATH PENALTY CASE WHERE THE COURT IS AFFIRMING A CONVICTION OF DEATH ON A DEFENDANT.SO BY ANALOGY, YOUR HONOR, IN THIS INSTANCE IF THE COURT SAID, AND THEY HAVE SAID CONSISTENTLY THROUGHOUT MANY YEARS NOW, THAT EVIDENCE OF MERE MOTIVE OR OPPORTUNITY IS INSUFFICIENT AS A MATTER OF LAW BASICALLY TO RAISE A REASONABLE DOUBT, THEN CERTAINLY IT APPLIES IN THIS SITUATION AS WELL.WHAT THE COURTS HAVE SAID CONSISTENTLY, THE APPELLATE COURT, IS THAT IT REQUIRES SOME EVIDENTIARY LINK LINKING THAT THIRD PERSON TO THE CULPABILITY AND THAT IS THE EVIDENTIARY LINK THAT FAILS ABYSMALLY HERE. AND THE DEFENSE CAN POINT TO AND HAS POINTED TO NO EVIDENTIARY LINK, ANY WAY, ANY EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THIS NOTION THAT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN WAS ABLE TO AND DID REMOVE THE GLOVE FROM ROCKINGHAM, THE ONE THAT WAS FOUND -- EXCUSE ME, THE GLOVE FROM BUNDY, THE ONE THAT WAS FOUND AT ROCKINGHAM.NOW, IN THE RESPONSIVE BRIEF, YOUR HONOR, THE DEFENSE ATTEMPTS TO CHARACTERIZE THIS AREA, THIS WHOLE ISSUE, AS BEING CENTRAL TO DETECTIVE FUHRMAN'S CREDIBILITY AND THEY HAVE LISTED AREAS THAT I WON'T ADDRESS AT THIS TIME WITH REGARD TO THEIR STATEMENT THAT HIS CREDIBILITY IS IMPORTANT, BUT THIS IS NOT REALLY ABOUT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN'S CREDIBILITY.THIS HAS BEEN AN ATTACK, AND WHAT THE DEFENSE SEEKS TO DO AT TRIAL, WILL BE AN ATTACK ON HIS CHARACTER BECAUSE NONE OF THE AREAS WHICH THE DEFENSE HAS LISTED IN THEIR RESPONSIVE PLEADING ARE AREAS WHERE DETECTIVE FUHRMAN'S CREDIBILITY IS REALLY VERY IMPORTANT. THEY ARE ALL AREAS WHERE THERE IS OTHER CORROBORATION AND THEY ARE AREAS WHERE THERE IS SIGNIFICANT IMPEACHMENT AVAILABLE IF THERE IS SOMETHING TO IMPEACH THAT IS IN THE FORM OF DIRECT IMPEACHMENT WITH OTHER OFFICERS, OTHER WITNESSES, OTHER EVIDENCE, BESIDES THE VERY COLLATERAL AND REMOTE EVIDENCE THAT I'M GOING TO GET TO IN A MINUTE THAT THE DEFENSE SEEKS TO USE HERE.NOW, IN THIS REGARD I THINK THE FACT THAT THIS IS NOT TRULY A CREDIBILITY ISSUE WITH REGARD TO DETECTIVE FUHRMAN IS HIGHLIGHTED BY THE FACT THAT IN THEIR RESPONSE BRIEF THE DEFENSE BRIEF FAILS TO SET FORTH THE DETECTIVE'S RECOVERY OF THE GLOVE AT ROCKINGHAM AS A CREDIBILITY ISSUE.THEY MANAGE TO COME UP WITH A LIST OF THINGS THAT THEY FEEL HIS CREDIBILITY IS IMPORTANT TO, BUT THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT THE CREDIBILITY IN FINDING THE GLOVE AND THAT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT DISCLAIMING THAT HE WALKED DOWN THAT PATHWAY, SAW THE GLOVE, SHOWED THE GLOVE TO THE OTHER DETECTIVES AND THAT THAT GLOVE WAS RECOVERED FROM ROCKINGHAM.THEY ARE NOT SAYING THAT HE IS LYING ABOUT THAT AND I THINK THAT IS HIGHLIGHTED BY ITS ABSENCE OF THE CREDIBILITY ON THAT AREA IN THEIR RESPONSE BRIEF. WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IN THAT REGARD IS THAT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN PLANTED THAT EVIDENCE, NOT THAT HE LIED ABOUT RECOVERING IT FROM THERE, SO THE PLANTING OF THAT EVIDENCE, YOUR HONOR, GOES TO HIS CHARACTER, NOT TO HIS CREDIBILITY, PER SE. IT IS REALLY A CHARACTER ATTACK, ACCUSING HIM OF DOING SOMETHING AND THEN PERHAPS LYING AT SOME POINT TO COVER IT UP, BUT THE THRUST AND THE HEART OF THEIR ACCUSATION IS THAT HE --

THAT HAS TO DO WITH HIS CHARACTER.NOW, I'VE CITED CASES AND TREATISES IN MY REPLY BRIEF, YOUR HONOR, THAT I WON'T BORE THE COURT WITH AT THIS TIME. THEY SET FORTH, HOWEVER, IN WITKIN NOTES, A COUPLE OR ONE MORE THING WITH REGARD TO COLLATERAL IMPEACHMENT, AND THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE HERE.

WE HAVE SUPPOSED IMPEACHMENT EVIDENCE OR ALLEGED IMPEACHMENT EVIDENCE THAT GOES TO THE CREDIBILITY OF A WITNESS AND IT DOESN'T EVEN GO DIRECTLY TO THE CREDIBILITY OF THE WITNESS. IT GOES ONLY INDIRECTLY BY INFERENCE.NOW, I THINK AT THIS POINT I NEED TO DISCUSS THE AREAS THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, YOUR HONOR, BECAUSE THE COURT OF COURSE, IN ADDITION TO THE FACTUAL CONTEXT, HAS TO LOOK AT THE AREAS THAT THE DEFENSE WE ANTICIPATE WILL SEEK TO IMPEACH WITH AND DETERMINE WHETHER THE PROBATIVE VALUE OF THAT EVIDENCE INDEED OUTWEIGHS THE PREJUDICIAL EFFECT AND THE OTHER CATEGORIES OF EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 352.NOW, ACTUALLY AT THIS POINT IN TIME, YOUR HONOR, I THINK I WILL GO THROUGH THE POINTS RAISED BY THE DEFENSE IN THEIR RESPONSE BRIEF, AND THERE ARE ELEVEN OF THEM THAT THEY MAKE, PRIOR TO TURNING TO THE EVIDENCE THAT THEY ARE SPECIFICALLY SEEKING TO BE EXCLUDED FROM BEING INTRODUCED.I DO WANT TO GO POINT BY POINT AS TO HOW CREDIBILITY IS NOT AN ISSUE WITH REGARD TO EACH OF THESE AREAS.MAY I HAVE JUST A MOMENT WITH COUNSEL, YOUR HONOR?BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICTATTORNEYS.)

THAT OF COURSE GOES BY THE WAYSIDE SINCE THE DETECTIVE IS NOT GOING TO BE TESTIFYING ABOUT IT. THAT IS SUBSUMED WITHIN THE FIRST ONE.

HIS MOTIVE -- DETECTIVE'S MOTIVES IN GOING TO ROCKINGHAM, THIS IS NOT A SUBJECT WHICH THE DEFENSE IS ENTITLED TO RELITIGATE IN FRONT OF THE JURY, YOUR HONOR.THOSE ARE QUESTIONS OF LAW WHICH THE MUNICIPAL COURT JUDGE DECIDED AND WHICH THIS COURT DECIDED IN THE NUMEROUS MOTIONS THAT WERE BROUGHT BEFORE IT, SO THAT IS SIMPLY NOT AN AREA OF INQUIRY WHICH SHOULD BE ALLOWED DURING TRIAL, HENCE, THE DETECTIVE'S CREDIBILITY IN THAT REGARD IS OF NO IMPORT, SINCE IT IS NOT SOMETHING HE WOULD BE TESTIFYING TO.THE ONLY AREA WHERE DETECTIVE FUHRMAN WILL BE TESTIFYING IS TO HIS CONVERSATION WITH KATO AND SUBSEQUENT GOING BACK BEHIND THE AREA TO WHERE THE GLOVE WAS LOCATED.THE NEXT THING THAT THE DEFENSE TALKS ABOUT IS DETECTIVE FUHRMAN'S DESCRIPTION OF THE FORD BRONCO AS IT WAS PARKED OUTSIDE OF THE ROCKINGHAM ESTATE. DETECTIVE FUHRMAN WILL NOT BE TESTIFYING TO THAT. MOREOVER, THERE ARE NUMEROUS WITNESSES WHO SAW THAT. THERE ARE PHOTOGRAPHS WHICH THE DEFENSE INDEED INTRODUCED AT THE 1538.5 HEARING IN MUNICIPAL COURT.

DETECTIVE FUHRMAN MADE A FEW NOTES WHILE AT BUNDY WHICH HE SUBSEQUENTLY TURNED OVER TO ROBBERY DIVISION.HE WAS NO LONGER AT THAT POINT AN INVESTIGATING OFFICER ON THE CASE, CONSEQUENTLY, THERE WAS NO REASON FOR HIM TO TAKE NOTES AT ROCKINGHAM.TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT FAILURE TO TAKE NOTES AT ROCKINGHAM HAS ANY IMPEACHMENT VALUE, THE MERE FAILURE IS WHAT IS IMPEACHING, BUT AGAIN, YOUR HONOR, THIS IS NOT AN AREA WHERE DETECTIVE FUHRMAN IS GOING TO BE TESTIFYING AND THEREFORE HIS CREDIBILITY IS NOT AT ISSUE IN THIS AREA.HIS -- THE NEXT THING THE DEFENSE ITEMIZES IN THEIR BRIEF IS HIS ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PRESERVATION OF EVIDENCE OR WHAT THE DEFENSE ACCUSES IS THE LACK OF PROPER PRESERVATION OF EVIDENCE IN THE CASE.NOW, THIS JUST GOES TO THE DEFENSE GENERAL ACCUSATION WHICH WE ARE EXPECTING WITH REGARD TO A LOT OF WITNESSES, THAT THERE WERE PROBLEMS WITH THE EVIDENCE. THAT IS CLEARLY ONE OF THEIR THEORIES IN ATTACKING THE PROSECUTION'S CASE.DETECTIVE FUHRMAN HAD NO ROLE OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR COLLECTING OR PRESERVING ANY OF THE EVIDENCE. HE WAS NOT AN INVESTIGATING OFFICER.AND FINALLY, YOUR HONOR, THE DEFENSE FEELS THAT THE DETECTIVES -- OR CLAIM THAT THE DETECTIVE'S CREDIBILITY IS IMPORTANT INSOFAR AS HE USED THE WORD ""THEM"" WHEN HE WAS BEING CROSS-EXAMINED BY MR. UELMEN DURING THE PRELIMINARY HEARING.THAT CROSS-EXAMINATION WAS -- THEY WERE TALKING, IF THE COURT LOOKS AT IT IN CONTEXT, ABOUT THE GLOVE AND OTHER ITEMS AT THE FEET OF RONALD GOLDMAN AND THERE HAD BEEN SEVERAL QUESTIONS REGARDING THE GLOVE ITSELF. THERE HAD BEEN TESTIMONY FROM DETECTIVE FUHRMAN THAT AT THE FEET OF RONALD GOLDMAN WAS NOT ONLY THE GLOVE, BUT THE DARK-COLORED WATCH CAP, THE WHITE ENVELOPE.AND DETECTIVE FUHRMAN, WHEN HE TESTIFIED AT THE PRELIMINARY HEARING, THINKING OF THE WATCH CAP, THE GLOVE WHICH HAD BEEN PART OF THE EARLIER TESTIMONY, SAID ""THEM.""WELL, MR. UELMEN CONTINUED ON IN NORMAL CROSS-EXAMINATION, BECAUSE THAT WAS NOT A SIGNIFICANT STATEMENT ON DETECTIVE FUHRMAN'S PART AND IT WASN'T TAKEN TO BE SUCH BY THE DEFENSE AT THE TIME. ALTHOUGH IT WAS SLIGHTLY AMBIGUOUS, THE DEFENSE FAILED TO QUESTION HIM FURTHER ABOUT THAT. THAT WAS SIMPLY NOT SOMETHING IMPORTANT.WHEN IT CAME TIME FOR THE PITCHESS MOTION, HOWEVER, YOUR HONOR, THE DEFENSE WENT OVER WITH A FINE TOOTH COMB TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANYTHING THAT THEY COULD BOOTSTRAP INTO AN ALLEGATION WHICH WOULD ENCOURAGE THE COURT TO GRANT THE PITCHESS MOTION. SO THAT SIMPLE STATEMENT OF DETECTIVE FUHRMAN'S WAS TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT AND WAS OVERBLOWN.NOW, YOUR HONOR, THERE ARE THE THREE AREAS OF INQUIRY WHICH WE ARE SEEKING TO PRECLUDE THE DEFENSE FROM GETTING INTO, AND TO RECOUNT THOSE FOR THE RECORD, ONE IS THE 14-YEAR WORKERS COMPENSATION LAWSUIT THAT THE DETECTIVE FILED AGAINST THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES.SPECIFICALLY IN THAT REGARD THERE WERE REPORTS FROM TWO CITY-HIRED PSYCHIATRISTS ATTRIBUTING CERTAIN RACIAL, RACIST STATEMENTS TO DETECTIVE FUHRMAN WHEN HE WAS IN THE THROWS OF THIS HOTLY CONTESTED LITIGATION AGAINST THE CITY.WITH REGARD TO THAT, THE DEFENSE HAS MADE NO OFFER OF PROOF, FRANKLY, AND THEY HAVE MADE NO OFFER OF PROOF THAT EITHER OF THESE DOCTORS, I'M NOT SURE IF IT IS HOCHMAN OR HOCKMAN AND DR. KOEGLER, WHETHER EITHER OF THESE DOCTORS HAVE ANY RECOLLECTION OF THESE STATEMENTS THEY WROTE IN THEIR LETTERS MANY, MANY YEARS AGO AND THAT THEY WOULD BE WILLING TO TESTIFY TO THEM.THE LETTERS OF COURSE BY THEMSELVES ARE INADMISSIBLE HEARSAY AND THE LETTERS ARE CONTAINED WITHIN LENGTHY -- THE PARTICULAR QUOTES ATTRIBUTED TO DETECTIVE FUHRMAN ARE CONTAINED WITHIN LENGTHY EVALUATIONS THAT GO FOR QUITE SOME TIME. DR. HOCHMAN'S LETTER I BELIEVE IS 14 PAGES. DR. KOEGLER IS EIGHT.THE SECOND AREA OF INQUIRY WHICH WE ARE SEEKING THE COURT TO ADDRESS IN ITS RULING IS THE -- IS SUPPOSED TESTIMONY FROM A WOMAN NAMED KATHLEEN BELL WHO CLAIMED IN AUGUST OF 1994 TO HAVE SUDDENLY REMEMBERED A VERY INFLAMMATORY RACIAL STATEMENT THAT SHE CLAIMS DETECTIVE FUHRMAN MADE EIGHT YEARS EARLIER.NOW, APPARENTLY THIS WOMAN HAS INDICATED THAT THIS WAS THE ONLY TIME IN HER LIFE SHE HAD CONTACT WITH DETECTIVE FUHRMAN, YET SHE REMEMBERS THIS INFLAMMATORY STATEMENT.AND FRANKLY, YOUR HONOR, HER -- HER CREDIBILITY OF COURSE IS AT ISSUE ANYWAY ON THIS. IT IS SUSPECT BECAUSE OF HAVING READ SOMETHING HAPPENING EIGHT YEARS AGO, BUT HER REACTION, WHICH HAS BEEN REPORTED TO IT OF CRYING WHEN SHE HEARD IT IS A VERY STRANGE ALLEGATION. WHEN I HEAR AN ALLEGATION OF RACISM, I GET ANGRY; I DON'T CRY. IT IS JUST A VERY STRANGE AND BIZARRE BEHAVIOR ON THIS WOMAN'S PART, SO HER TESTIMONY IS IMMEDIATELY SUSPECT.SHE INDICATED THAT SHE OVERHEARD THIS STATEMENT WHILE SHE AND DETECTIVE FUHRMAN WERE AT A MARINE RECRUITING QUARTERS, MARINE RECRUITING OFFICE AT I GUESS WHAT CAN BE CALLED A STRIP MALL IN REDONDO BEACH. THIS WOMAN APPARENTLY WAS -- HAD TO DO WITH A REAL ESTATE OFFICE THERE IN THE SAME STRIP MALL AND FROM WHAT -- IN READING BETWEEN THE LINES, IT APPEARS THAT SHE WAS HANGING AROUND THE MARINES, SO ON THIS ONE OCCASION SHE SEEMS TO RECOLLECT NOW EIGHT YEARS LATER THAT THIS STATEMENT THAT SHE CLAIMS TO HAVE HEARD, IF SHE HEARD IT AT ALL, WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THIS PARTICULAR DETECTIVE WHO SHE DIDN'T SEE FOR THE NEXT EIGHT YEARS.IN ADDITION, YOUR HONOR, THE PROSECUTION HAS AT LEAST TWO AND LIKELY THREE MARINES WHO WERE THERE AT THE RECRUITING STATION AT THE TIME WHO SAID THAT NO SUCH REMARK WAS MADE. AND I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE FOR THE COURT THAT ONE OF THOSE MARINES WAS A HEAVY, TALL, BODY BUILDER, AFRICAN AMERICAN.NOW, ON ITS FACE THE ABSURDITY OF BELIEVING THAT MARK FUHRMAN MADE A RACIST STATEMENT IN FRONT OF A TALL BURLY AFRICAN AMERICAN, IT IS JUST CRAZY, SO THAT AGAIN MAKES KATHLEEN BELL'S STATEMENT HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS.THE THIRD AREA THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING IN THIS MOTION, YOUR HONOR, IS WITH REGARD TO ACTIVITY OF A JOSEPH BRITTON WHICH OCCURRED IN 1987, AND IN 1987 JOSEPH BRITTON WAS ATTEMPTING, WITH THE USE OF A BUTCHER KNIFE, TO ROB A JAPANESE MAN, AS IT HAPPENED, THE JAPANESE AMERICAN MAN AT AN ATM, WHEN HE WAS INTERRUPTED WITH A COHORT. WHEN HE WAS INTERRUPTED IN THAT REGARD BY DETECTIVE FUHRMAN AND HIS PARTNER AND THAT THAT INTERRUPTION INVOLVED -- AS A RESULT RESULTED IN AN OFFICER-INVOLVED SHOOTING WHEN DETECTIVE -- EXCUSE ME -- WHEN JOSEPH BRITTON ATTEMPTED TO FLEE FROM THE OFFICERS AND BRANDISHED THIS BUTCHER KNIFE.NOW, JOSEPH BRITTON PLED GUILTY TO THE ROBBERY, WHICH IS OBVIOUS TO THE COURT AND MAYBE NOT TO OTHER PEOPLE, IS A FELONY, AND HE ADMITTED THE USE OF A DANGEROUS AND DEADLY WEAPON, IN THIS CASE A KNIFE, IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDING THAT WAS BROUGHT AGAINST HIM IN THAT REGARD.NOW, THIS IS ANOTHER AREA WHERE THERE HAS BEEN A FAILURE OF AN OFFER OF PROOF FROM THE DEFENSE AND WHERE THE EVIDENCE THAT IS KNOWN WITH REGARD TO JOSEPH BRITTON SHOWS IT TO BE VERY WEAK AND LACKING IN PROBATIVE VALUE.MR. BRITTON, IN ADDITION TO HAVING BEEN AN ARMED ROBBER WHO WAS SUCCESSFULLY INTERRUPTED DURING THAT ROBBERY, SUFFERED ANOTHER ROBBERY CONVICTION, A FELONY, AROUND THE SAME TIME PERIOD, I BELIEVE IT WAS A FEW MONTHS LATER, AND I HAVE THE CASE NUMBERS IF THERE IS ANY QUESTION ABOUT THAT.SO MR. BRITTON'S CREDIBILITY WOULD BE HIGHLY SUSPECT IF THAT ALONE WERE THE SITUATION AND HE WERE TO COME IN AND TESTIFY WITH REGARD TO SOME MOVING OF EVIDENCE, BUT THAT IS NOT EVEN ALL THAT THE COURT HAS TO CONSIDER IN THIS REGARD. ALSO IN THIS REGARD MR. BRITTON, IN HIS OWN DEPOSITION, DESCRIBES THE MAN WHO HE BELIEVES SHOT HIM AS HAVING RED HAIR AND A MUSTACHE, AND THOUGH HE MAY BE ONE OF THE FEW THAT I AM AWARE OF, IT IS A FACT THAT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN HAS NEVER IN HIS CAREER AS A POLICE OFFICER HAD A MUSTACHE AND HE CERTAINLY DOESN'T HAVE RED HAIR, AS THE COURT HAS SEEN, AND NEVER HAD RED HAIR.IN ADDITION TO THAT, JOSEPH BRITTON, WHEN HE WAS INTERVIEWED ON CBS EVENING NEWS ON OCTOBER 12, AND WE APPENDED TO OUR BRIEF A COPY OF THAT SCRIPT, INDICATED THAT HE CAN'T SAY THAT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN MOVED ANY EVIDENCE, MOVED THAT KNIFE, AND THE ALLEGATION WITH REGARD TO THAT IS THAT JOSEPH BRITTON CLAIMS HE THREW THE KNIFE WHEN HE WAS RUNNING AND IT WAS MOVED FROM THE LOCATION WHERE HE THREW IT TO HIS FEET. THE OFFICERS INVOLVED IN THE SHOOTING FOUND IT AT HIS FEET WHEN HE DROPPED IT AFTER HAVING BEEN SHOT.BUT JOSEPH BRITTON ON CBS EVENING NEWS INDICATED TO THE COUNTRY THAT HE COULDN'T SAY THAT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN DID THAT, NOR COULD HE SAY THAT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN MADE A RACIST REMARK TO HIM.SO WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE THAT THE DEFENSE WOULD HAVE TO SEEK TO IMPEACH IN THIS REGARD? IT APPEARS TO US, YOUR HONOR, THAT THE DEFENSE IS JUST ATTEMPTING TO INQUIRE INTO THESE THINGS TO CAST A SUSPICION, TO RAISE REASONABLE DOUBT, WHEN THERE REALLY IS NOTHING BEHIND IT AND NOTHING TO SUPPORT IT.ALL RIGHT. THERE IS A LOT OF AREAS FOR THE COURT OF COURSE TO CONSIDER UNDER SECTION 352, AND I WOULD LIKE TO GO OVER THEM INDIVIDUALLY.ONE OF THOSE AREAS THAT THE COURT HAS TO CONSIDER IS WHETHER PUTTING ON ALL THIS COLLATERAL EVIDENCE WOULD NECESSITATE AN UNDUE CONSUMPTION OF THE COURT'S TIME, AND IT WOULD WITH REGARD TO EACH OF THESE INCIDENTS.WITH REGARD TO THE CITY-HIRED PSYCHIATRIST, THERE WOULD BE EXTENSIVE -- ASSUMING THAT THE DEFENSE CAN EVEN REPRESENT THAT THEY ARE WILLING AND ABLE TO TESTIFY, THERE WOULD OF COURSE BE EXTENSIVE EXAMINATION OF THEM. THE PEOPLE, THE PROSECUTION MIGHT CHOOSE TO CALL DETECTIVE FUHRMAN'S PSYCHIATRIST WHO INTERVIEWED HIM BACK IN THE SAME TIME PERIOD AND WE WOULD OPEN A WHOLE AREA OF INQUIRY WHICH IS TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE, TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE TO THE ISSUES BEFORE THIS JURY WITH REGARD TO WHETHER OR NOT THE DEFENDANT COMMITTED THE MURDERS OF THESE TWO VICTIMS.IF KATHLEEN BELL TESTIFIES OF COURSE WE WILL PUT ON THE MARINES WHO REFUTE HER TESTIMONY. ALL OF THAT TAKES AN UNDUE CONSUMPTION OF TIME.AND OF COURSE IF JOSEPH BRITTON TESTIFIES HE WILL BE IMPEACHED WITH THESE AREAS I HAVE JUST INDICATED, HIS STATEMENT BEFORE THE COUNTRY ON THE NATIONAL NEWS THAT HE CAN'T SAY MARK FUHRMAN MOVED ANY EVIDENCE AND THAT HE CAN'T SAY MARK FUHRMAN MADE ANY RACIAL SLUR, BECAUSE HE DIDN'T.IN ADDITION, WE WOULD SEEK TO IMPEACH JOSEPH BRITTON WITH HIS -- WITH BOTH OF HIS ROBBERY CONVICTIONS, THE ATTEMPTED CONVICTION, AS WELL AS THE OTHER ROBBERY CONVICTION, SO THAT WOULD NECESSITATE A CASTRO HEARING WITH REGARD TO THAT HEARING.IN ADDITION, YOUR HONOR, WERE THE DEFENSE SUCCESSFUL IN ALL OF THIS REGARD, THE PEOPLE, THE PROSECUTION WOULD LIKELY PUT ON CHARACTER EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF DETECTIVE FUHRMAN, VARIOUS AFRICAN AMERICANS, THE AFRICAN AMERICAN SERGEANT AND AFRICAN AMERICAN DETECTIVE WITH WHOM HE REGULARLY PLAYS BASKETBALL AND NUMEROUS OTHER AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO KNOW MARK FUHRMAN WELL AND KNOW THAT HE IS NOT A RACIST AND WOULD NOT MAKE THESE KIND OF RACIAL SLURS THAT THE DEFENSE IS ALLEGING THAT HE MADE MANY YEARS AGO.ANOTHER AREA, AND THE -- AN OBVIOUS AREA IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE WITH REGARD TO THESE THREE AREAS FOR THE COURT TO CONSIDER IS THE REMOTENESS OF THE EVIDENCE AND THAT IS WHAT REALLY BRINGS HOME THE LACK OF PROBATIVE VALUE IN THESE AREAS IN PARTICULAR.THAT WORKERS COMPENSATION LAWSUIT WAS FOURTEEN YEARS AGO, 1981, FOURTEEN YEARS AGO NOW. ONE OF THE DOCTOR'S LETTERS IS IN 1982, THIRTEEN YEARS AGO. THAT EVIDENCE IS EXTREMELY REMOTE.THE KATHLEEN BELL ALLEGATION THAT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN IS THE ONE WHO HEARD THESE SUPPOSED REMARKS THAT CAUSED HER TO CRY RATHER THAN BECOME ANGRY, THAT ALLEGATION HAPPENED SHE SAYS IN 1985 OR 1986. THAT WAS EIGHT OR NINE YEARS AGO.THE JOSEPH BRITTON ATTEMPTED ARMED ROBBERY HAPPENED EIGHT YEARS AGO, SO ALL OF THESE AREAS ARE EXTREMELY REMOTE WHEN IT COMES TO CREDIBILITY.NOW, IN THIS REGARD, AS THE COURT KNOWS, THE LEGISLATURE, IN ENACTING THE PITCHESS STATUTES, MADE A DETERMINATION OF A FIVE-YEAR CUT OFF FOR POLICE OFFICER PERSONNEL FILES TO BE DISCOVERABLE TO THE DEFENSE AND THEY SAID BASICALLY THAT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT NEED NOT MAINTAIN PERSONNEL FILES OF A POLICE OFFICER BEYOND FIVE YEARS BECAUSE AT THAT POINT IN TIME ANYTHING WITHIN THEM IS NO LONGER RELEVANT, EVEN FOR DISCOVERY PURPOSES.AND THE COURT OF APPEAL, IN THE CASE CITED IN OUR BRIEF, CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, I BELIEVE, HELD THAT -- HELD THAT THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINED THAT AS A MATTER OF LAW THAT BEYOND FIVE YEARS IS NOT RELEVANT.SO THIS ATTEMPT BY THE DEFENSE, SHOULD THEY ATTEMPT CROSS-EXAMINATION ON THIS -- IN THIS AREA -- ON ANY OF THESE AREAS, IS REALLY AN ATTEMPT TO GET AROUND WHAT IS ALMOST AND CAN ALMOST BE CONSIDERED A STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS IN THE PITCHESS AREA.NOW, YOUR HONOR, THE THREE AREAS WHICH WE HAVE ADDRESSED ARE THOSE THAT THIS MOTION SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES. WE ALSO, AS PART OF THIS MOTION, WOULD ASK THE COURT TO PRECLUDE THE DEFENSE FROM ASKING DETECTIVE FUHRMAN WHETHER HE HARBORS RACIAL HOSTILITY TOWARD AFRICAN AMERICANS. OF COURSE IF THAT WERE ALLOWED, WHAT THIS MOTION SEEKS TO DO IS PRECLUDE THEM FROM IMPEACHING WITH THESE AREAS THAT WE HAVE DESCRIBED IN OUR BRIEF, BUT THAT AREA OF INQUIRY ITSELF IS SO INCREDIBLY VOLATILE, YOUR HONOR, AND IS SO REMOTE FROM ANY OF THE ISSUES AT THIS TRIAL THAT ITS PREJUDICIAL EFFECT FAR OUTWEIGHS ANY PROBATIVE VALUE, BECAUSE AS I INDICATED, DETECTIVE FUHRMAN IS NOT GOING TO BE TESTIFYING WITH REGARD TO THESE OTHER AREAS WHICH THE DEFENSE SEEMS TO FEEL HIS CREDIBILITY IS AT ISSUE ON. IT IS NOT, BECAUSE HE WILL NOT BE TESTIFYING THERE.IN REGARD TO WHETHER THE DEFENSE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO INQUIRE INTO THAT AREA, ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT CONTAINED WITHIN THE DEFENSE RESPONSE BRIEF, I DO FEEL AN OBLIGATION, AS AN OFFICER OF THE COURT, TO MAKE THE COURT AWARE OF A CASE CALLED IN RE ANTHONY P. IT IS A 1985 COURT OF APPEAL CASE AT 167 CAL.APP.3D 502.IN THAT CASE, YOUR HONOR, THERE WAS A 17-YEAR OLD AFRICAN AMERICAN DEFENDANT, A 15-YEAR OLD WHITE VICTIM. THERE WAS A PETITION SUSTAINED AGAINST THAT AFRICAN AMERICAN JUVENILE FOR A CHILD MOLESTATION AND BATTERY.IN THAT CASE THE DEFENDANT AND THE VICTIM WENT TO THE SAME HIGH SCHOOL. THE DETECTIVE TESTIFIED THAT THE DEFENDANT APPROACHED HER AND ASKED HER FOR A DATE AND THAT SHE REFUSED AND SHE CLAIMS THAT THE DEFENDANT AT THAT POINT GRABBED HER IN VARIOUS SEXUAL AREAS OF HER BODY AND SHE FLED FROM HIM AND SAW A SCHOOLMATE AND ASKED FOR HIS HELP.THE SCHOOLMATE TESTIFIED THAT SHE APPROACHED HIM AND WAS NERVOUS, BUT THERE WERE NO OTHER WITNESSES -- THERE WERE NO WITNESSES TO THE ENCOUNTER ITSELF BETWEEN THE DEFENDANT AND THE VICTIM, NONE AT ALL, NOR WERE THERE ANY WITNESSES TO THE VICTIM'S HAVING RUN AWAY, SO IT WAS A ONE-ON-ONE CREDIBILITY CONTEST, CROSS-RACIAL BETWEEN THE VICTIM AND THE DEFENDANT.AND IN FACT THE COURT OF APPEAL IN THAT CASE SAID, AND I QUOTE FROM PAGE 506:""THE ENTIRE CASE AGAINST APPELLANT HINGED ENTIRELY ON THE CREDIBILITY OF ONE WITNESS, DEBORAH M, WHO WAS THE VICTIM.""THE COURT OF APPEAL HELD IN THAT CASE, YOUR HONOR, THAT:""THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN REFUSING THE DEFENSE TO PURSUE A LINE OF INQUIRY WITH REGARD TO WHETHER THE VICTIM HARBORED FEELINGS OF RACIAL ANIMOSITY,"" AND INDEED THE COURT OF APPEAL REVERSED THE SUSTAINING OF THE PETITION ON THAT GROUND.I WOULD NOTE IT WAS DIVISION 7.YOUR HONOR, THAT SITUATION IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE HAVE HERE. ALTHOUGH -- DOES THE COURT WISH ME TO ALLOW THE -- DOES THE COURT WISH ME TO ALLOW THE COURT AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A LOOK BEFORE I CONTINUE?

","JANUARY 13, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
#MS. LEWIS: ,"YOUR HONOR, IN THAT CASE THE DEFENSE APPARENTLY HAD NO INFORMATION WITH REGARD TO RACIAL HOSTILITY AND SO THEY WERE REALLY IN A BLIND SITUATION.HERE THE DEFENSE HAS FULLY, APPARENTLY FROM ALL WE AS THE PROSECUTION CAN TELL, HAS FULLY INVESTIGATED DETECTIVE FUHRMAN AND THE BEST THEY HAVE APPARENTLY MANAGED TO COME UP WITH THIS OLD, REMOTE, INFLAMMATORY EVIDENCE WHICH HAS INCREDIBLY WEAK PROBATIVE VALUE.AND I JUST WANT TO REITERATE TO THE COURT A COUPLE OF THINGS. ONE IS THAT IT IS COLLATERAL, TO START WITH, AND THE CASES HAVE SAID THAT IT DOES NOT DENY EFFECTIVE CROSS-EXAMINATION TO A DEFENDANT TO PRECLUDE THE DEFENSE FROM INTRODUCING EVIDENCE THAT GOES ONLY TO THE WEIGHT OF DIRECT TESTIMONY.AND THIS EVIDENCE IS NOT ONLY COLLATERAL BECAUSE IT IS COLLATERAL ON THE AREA OF IMPEACHMENT, IT IS EVEN A FURTHER STEP REMOVED, BECAUSE EVEN ON THAT AREA YOU HAVE TO LEAP FROM INFERENCE TO INFERENCE. YOU HAVE TO LEAP FROM THE INFERENCE THAT RACIAL STATEMENTS THAT WERE MADE FOURTEEN YEARS AGO, EVEN EIGHT YEARS AGO, YOU HAVE TO LEAP FROM THAT INFERENCE THAT THAT SUPPLIES A MOTIVE THAT WOULD ACTUALLY CAUSE A DETECTIVE TO LIE DURING HIS TESTIMONY OR TO DO ANYTHING TO HARM THE PERSON BECAUSE OF THIS REMOTE, ANCIENT STATEMENTS THAT HE MADE.SO IT IS INCREDIBLY REMOTE TO ALL OF THE ISSUES AT HAND AND INCREDIBLY COLLATERAL TO ALL OF THE ISSUES AT HAND AND THAT IS CERTAINLY UNLIKE THE ANTHONY P. CASE WHERE IT WAS CENTRAL -- THAT VICTIM'S CREDIBILITY, SINCE THERE WAS ZERO CORROBORATION, WAS CENTRAL TO THE CASE.NOW, YOUR HONOR, IN THE DEFENSE RESPONSE BRIEF, THE DEFENSE INDICATES THAT THIS MOTION IS NOT RIPE FOR RESOLUTION. ONE THING WE ARE SEEKING FROM THIS COURT IS THE PRECLUSION OF GETTING INTO AN AREA OF WHETHER OR NOT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN IS A RACIST. THIS IS NOT A TRIAL ON DETERMINING WHETHER THESE STATEMENTS ATTRIBUTED TO HIM MANY YEARS AGO ARE GOING TO BE USEFUL IN TERMS OF THE JURY'S ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER OR NOT DEFENDANT SIMPSON COMMITTED THESE MURDERS. IT IS EXTREMELY COLLATERAL IN THAT SENSE AS WELL.NOW, ALONG THOSE LINES WE NEED A RULING FROM THIS COURT. WE ARE ASKING FOR A RULING FROM THIS COURT THAT THE DEFENSE BE PRECLUDED FROM ASKING THE DETECTIVE CURRENTLY THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT RACISM AND WHETHER HE IS A RACIST. THEY ARE UNDULY PREJUDICIAL, PARTICULARLY UNDER ALL OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WE HAVE HERE. THEY HAVE ALREADY MALIGNED HIM EXTENSIVELY WITHIN THE MEDIA AND THAT MALIGNMENT HE WILL SUFFER WITH AND CARRY WITH HIM THE REST OF HIS LIFE.I WANT TO REMIND THE COURT THAT THE EVIDENCE CODE DOES ASK THAT THE COURT PROTECT WITNESSES FROM HARASSMENT, AND WHEN THAT DETECTIVE TESTIFIES IN THIS COURTROOM, THE COURT WILL HAVE THE POWER AND THE ABILITY TO HEED EVIDENCE CODE 765 AND PROTECT THAT WITNESS FROM THE TYPE OF HARASSMENT HE HAS HAD TO UNDERGO IN THE MEDIA AND THROUGH THE PRESS BECAUSE OF THESE GROUNDLESS BASELESS DEFENSE ACCUSATIONS WITH REGARD TO THE GLOVE.NOW, YOUR HONOR, THE FINAL AREA UNDER SECTION 352 CONCERNS THE PREJUDICIAL EFFECT OF THE EVIDENCE. IT IS SELF-EVIDENT TO A CERTAIN EXTENT OF COURSE WHEN SOMEONE ISSUES THE ""N"" WORD OR ANY OTHER RACIAL EPITHET IN FRONT OF ANYBODY, AND ESPECIALLY IN FRONT OF A MEMBER OF THAT MINORITY GROUP, IT HAS AN INFLAMMATORY EFFECT THAT IS INCOMPARABLE, AND TO THAT SPECIFIC ISSUE MR. DARDEN WISHES TO ADDRESS THE COURT, AND I THINK I WILL CONCLUDE MY COMMENTS AT THIS TIME.

#THE COURT: ,"ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, MISS LEWIS.MR. DARDEN, GOOD MORNING.
","JANUARY 13, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
#MR. DARDEN: ,"GOOD MORNING, YOUR HONOR.YOUR HONOR, I THINK THE BEST INDICATIONAL EVIDENCE OF JUST HOW INFLAMMATORY THE USE OF THIS WORD IS IS A FACT THAT IT APPEARS THAT MR. COCHRAN AND I, THE ONLY TWO BLACK LEAD LAWYERS ON EACH SIDE OF THE COUNSEL TABLE, ARE SOMEHOW DRAGGED INTO THIS ISSUE TO ARGUE THE ISSUE TO THE COURT, AND I THINK THAT MAY BE DUE IN SOME PART TO THE FACT THAT IF ANYONE SHOULD SLIP AND SAY OR UTTER THE WORD, IT IS PROBABLY BETTER TO HAVE A BLACK PERSON DO IT, BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE A WHITE PERSON DO IT, IF A WHITE MALE TAKES THE WITNESS STAND AND THAT WORD IS UTTERED IN THIS COURTROOM, IT WILL OFFEND EVERY BLACK JUROR ON THIS CASE. IT WILL OFFEND ME, IT WILL OFFEND MR. COCHRAN, IT WILL OFFEND MR. SIMPSON, IT WILL OFFEND THE AFRICAN AMERICAN REPORTERS IN THIS COURTROOM AND IT WILL OFFEND THE PUBLIC AND ANY OTHER AFRICAN AMERICAN WITHIN EARSHOT OF THAT WORD.IT IS A DIRTY FILTHY WORD. IT IS NOT A WORD THAT I ALLOW PEOPLE TO USE IN MY HOUSEHOLD. I'M SURE MR. COCHRAN DOESN'T. AND THE REASON WE DON'T IS BECAUSE IT IS AN EXTREMELY DEROGATORY AND DENIGRATING TERM BECAUSE IT IS SO PREJUDICIAL AND SO EXTREMELY INFLAMMATORY THAT TO USE THAT WORD IN ANY SITUATION WILL EVOKE SOME TYPE OF EMOTIONAL RESPONSE FROM ANY AFRICAN AMERICAN WITHIN EARSHOT OF THAT WORD.I SPOKE TO DEAN UELMEN EARLIER THIS MORNING AND I ASKED HIM -- I SAID, ""DEAN, ARE YOU GOING TO USE THE ""N"" WORD DURING ARGUMENT TODAY?"" HE SAID, ""NOPE, NOT ME.""WELL, IF DEAN UELMEN DOESN'T WANT TO UTTER THE WORD AND IF HAD COCHRAN DOESN'T UTTER THE WORD OR ALLOW OTHERS TO USE THAT WORD IN HIS HOUSEHOLD, AND I CERTAINLY DON'T, WHY THEN SHOULD WE ALLOW THAT WORD IN USE IN THIS COURTROOM? ESPECIALLY IN A CASE LIKE THIS WHERE IT HAS NO PROBATIVE VALUE. IT IS COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT. IT WAS CREATED AND DESIGNED TO DO ONE THING, AND THAT IS TO DEMEAN PEOPLE, TO STRIP PEOPLE OF THEIR HUMANITY, TO EVOKE AN EMOTIONAL RESPONSE.YOUR HONOR, WHEN YOU USE THAT WORD YOU ARE USING FIGHTING WORDS. WHEN YOU USE THAT WORD IN THE PRESENCE OF AN AFRICAN AMERICAN YOU ARE ASKING THAT AFRICAN AMERICAN FOR A REACTION. IT IS A CALL TO ARMS. IT IS A TEST. IT IS A TEST OF EVERY AFRICAN AMERICAN WHEN THEY HEAR THAT WORD AND THE TEST IS WHERE DO YOU STAND? ON WHICH SIDE OF THE LINE DO YOU STAND?BECAUSE WHEN THAT WORD IS USED IN THE PRESENCE OF AN AFRICAN AMERICAN, AN AFRICAN AMERICAN HAS AN OBLIGATION TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, TO SAY SOMETHING. AN AFRICAN AMERICAN HAS A DUTY, IN MOST SITUATIONS TO CONFRONT, TO CONFRONT THE DECLARANT.IT IS THE FILTHIEST, DIRTIEST, NASTIEST WORD IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. IT HAS NO PLACE IN THIS CASE OR IN THIS COURTROOM. IT WILL DO NOTHING TO FURTHER THE COURT'S ATTEMPT AT SEEKING THE TRUTH IN THIS CASE.IT WILL DO ONE THING. IT WILL UPSET THE BLACK JURORS, IT WILL ISSUE A TEST, IT WILL GIVE THEM THE TEST AND THE TEST WILL BE WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON? THE SIDE OF THE WHITE PROSECUTORS AND THE WHITE POLICEMEN OR ON THE SIDE OF THE BLACK DEFENDANT AND HIS VERY PROMINENT AND BLACK LAWYER? THAT IS WHAT IT IS GOING TO DO. EITHER YOU ARE WITH THE MAN OR YOU ARE WITH THE BROTHERS. THAT IS WHAT IT DOES. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IT DOES.NO ONE, NO AFRICAN AMERICAN CAN HEAR THAT WORD WITHOUT GETTING UPSET. YOU HEAR IT IN THE MOVIES; IT UPSETS YOU. PEOPLE DON'T LISTEN TO RAP MUSIC, BLACK PEOPLE, BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE THAT WORD. THEY DON'T LIKE THE USE OF THAT WORD, AND IF YOU SEARCH BLACK LIGATURE TODAY, BLACK MAGAZINES, YOU WILL SEE LETTERS, WRITERS AND ARTICLES AND PEOPLE ASKING WHY THAT WORD IS USED, WHY DOES THAT WORD EXIST? WHY WOULD ANYBODY WANT TO USE IT? WHY WOULD ANYBODY WANT TO RAP ABOUT IT? WHY WOULD ANYBODY WANT TO WRITE ABOUT IT? WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO REPEAT IT OR SAY IT?THE WORD HAS NO PLACE IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. IT HAS NO PLACE IN THIS COURTROOM.YOU SHOULDN'T LET THEM USE IT.I'M NOT GOING TO SAY THE WORD. WE ALL KNOW WHAT THE WORD IS. IF MR. COCHRAN USES THAT WORD TODAY I'M GOING TO BE OFFENDED, AND IT IS PROBABLY THE THIRD OR FOR THE TIME THIS WEEK THAT I HAVE BEEN OFFENDED, BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT BE OFFENDED. HOW CAN THE JURY HELP BUT BE OFFENDED?DETECTIVE FUHRMAN IS GOING TO PLAY A VERY, VERY SMALL ROLE IN THIS CASE. THIS WASN'T HIS CASE. HE WAS NOT THE INVESTIGATING OFFICER OR THE LEAD INVESTIGATING OFFICER IN THIS CASE. HE WENT TO ROCKINGHAM WITH FOUR OTHER DETECTIVES OR THREE OTHER DETECTIVES AND HE JUST HAPPENED TO FIND AN ITEM. PURE HAPPENSTANCE. PURE LUCK ON THE PART OF THE POLICE AND CERTAINLY ON THE PART OF THE PROSECUTION. HE JUST HAPPENED TO FIND A GLOVE. ONE ITEM.THE MAN FINDS ONE ITEM AMONGST SIX OR SEVEN OR 800 OTHER ITEMS COLLECTED BY THE POLICE IN THIS CASE AND NOW WHEN THE MAN IS CALLED TO THE WITNESS STAND WE ARE GOING TO GO FIFTEEN YEARS BACK OR FOURTEEN YEARS BACK AND ASK HIM IF HE EVER MADE A RACIAL SLUR, REPEATED A RACIAL EPITHET? WHY? WHAT IS THE POINT OF THAT WHEN THE DETECTIVE IS GOING TO PLAY SUCH A SMALL ROLE IN THIS CASE?THERE IS NO LEGAL PURPOSE. THERE IS NO VALID OR LEGITIMATE PURPOSE.BUT MR. COCHRAN AND THE DEFENSE, THEY HAVE A PURPOSE IN GOING INTO THAT AREA AND THE PURPOSE IS TO INFLAME THE PASSIONS OF THE JURY AND TO ASK THEM TO PICK SIDES NOT ON THE BASIS OF THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE. AND THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE AGAINST THIS DEFENDANT IS OVERWHELMING. THERE IS A MOUNTAIN OF EVIDENCE POINTING TO THIS DEFENDANT'S GUILT.BUT WHEN YOU MENTION THAT WORD TO THIS JURY OR TO ANY AFRICAN AMERICAN, IT BLINDS PEOPLE. IT WILL BLIND THE JURY, IT WILL BLIND THEM TO THE TRUTH. THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO DISCERN WHAT IS TRUE AND WHAT IS NOT. IT WILL AFFECT THEIR JUDGMENT, IT WILL IMPAIR THEIR ABILITY TO BE FAIR AND IMPARTIAL. IT WILL CAUSE EXTREME PREJUDICE TO THE PROSECUTION'S CASE.YOU KNOW, AND WE DO HAVE A RIGHT, YOUR HONOR, AND I KNOW THE COURT IS WELL AWARE OF IT AND I DON'T HAVE TO EDUCATE THE COURT ON THIS POINT, BUT WE HAVE A RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL JUST LIKE THE DEFENDANT HAS. WE ARE NOT RUNNING AROUND OR TALKING ABOUT OR SEEKING TO INTRODUCE TO THE JURY THE NOTION THAT THIS DEFENDANT HAS A FETISH FOR BLOND-HAIRED WHITE WOMEN. THAT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE. THAT WOULD INFLAME THE PASSIONS OF THE JURY. IT WOULD BE OUTRAGEOUS.THE USE OF THAT WORD IN THIS CASE IS OUTRAGEOUS. THE USE OF THAT WORD WILL INFLAME THE PASSIONS OF THE JURY. THIS ISN'T A RACE CASE.MR. COCHRAN WANTS TO PLAY THE ACE OF SPADES AND PLAY THE RACE CARD, BUT THIS ISN'T A RACE CASE. WE SHOULDN'T ALLOW HIM TO PLAY THAT CARD. WE SHOULDN'T ALLOW HIM TO PLAY THAT CARD IF WHAT WE ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN IS PLAYING BY THE RULES, FINDING OUT JUST WHAT HAPPENED AT BUNDY AND IF WE ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN SEARCHING FOR THE TRUTH.YESTERDAY I HANDED TO THE COURT SOME ARTICLES AND XEROXED COPIES OF A COUPLE OF CHAPTERS FROM A COUPLE OF BOOKS, AND THEY INCLUDED ANDREW HACKER'S TWO NATIONS, AND IF I MIGHT, I WOULD LIKE TO DIRECT THE COURT'S ATTENTION TO PAGE 43 OF TWO NATIONS AND READ INTO THE RECORD A PARTICULAR QUOTE, AND I WOULD LIKE TO READ THIS QUOTE BECAUSE I THINK THIS QUOTE FAIRLY DESCRIBES THE IMPACT AND EFFECT THE HEARING OF THIS WORD HAS AND WILL HAVE ON ANY AFRICAN AMERICANS ON THE JURY.WITH REGARD TO THIS ""N"" WORD HACKER WRITES:""WHEN A WHITE PERSON VOICES IT, IT BECOMES A KNIFE WITH A WHETTED EDGE. NO BLACK PERSON CAN HEAR IT WITH EQUANIMITY OR IGNORE IT AS SIMPLY A WORD. THIS WORD HAS THE FORCE TO PIERCE, TO WOUND, TO PENETRATE AS NO OTHER HAS. THERE HAVE OF COURSE BEEN TERMS LIKE 'KIKE' AND 'SPIC' AND 'CHINK'"" AND I HAVE USED THOSE WORDS AND I APOLOGIZE FOR USING THOSE TERMS, YOUR HONOR, ""BUT THESE ARE LESS FREQUENTLY HEARD TODAY AND THEY LACK THE SAME EMOTIONAL IMPACT. SOME NON-ETHNIC TERMS COME CLOSER, SUCH AS 'SLUT' AND 'FAG' AND 'CRIPPLE.' YET THE ""N"" WORD STANDS ALONE WITH THIS POWER TO TEAR AT ONE'S INSIDES. IT WILL REVEAL THAT WHITES HAVE NEVER CREATED SO WRENCHING AN EPITHET FOR EVEN THE MOST BEKNIGHTED MEMBERS OF THEIR OWN RACE. IT IS A PERSISTENT REMINDER THAT YOU ARE STILL PERCEIVED AS A DEGRADED SPECIES OF HUMANITY, A LEVEL TO WHICH WHITES CAN NEVER DESCEND.""MR. COCHRAN WOULD LIKE TO ASK A WHITE POLICE OFFICER IF HE EVER USED THAT WORD AND AFTER THAT WHITE POLICE OFFICER TESTIFIES THERE WILL BE OTHER WHITE MALE POLICE OFFICERS, AND BY THE TIME THOSE OTHER OFFICERS TESTIFY THEY WILL -- THE JURY WILL HAVE HEARD THIS WORD, THEY WILL BE UPSET, THEY WILL HAVE BECOME EMOTIONAL, AND AS SOON AS MR. COCHRAN WORKS THEM UP INTO THAT EMOTIONAL FRENZY HE WOULD LIKE TO GET THEM INTO, AS SOON AS HE DOES THAT AND THE NEXT WHITE POLICE OFFICER TAKES THE WITNESS STAND, THE JURY IS GOING TO PAINT THAT WHITE POLICE OFFICER WITH THE SAME BRUSH MR. COCHRAN PAINTED DETECTIVE FUHRMAN.AND THERE BEGINS THE DECLINE OF THE PROSECUTION'S CASE, A VERY GOOD CASE I MIGHT ADD.THIS WORD HAS NO PLACE IN THIS COURTROOM AND IT SHOULD NOT BE HEARD BEFORE THE JURY.I KNOW THE COURT PROBABLY HAS HAD ITS OWN EXPERIENCE WITH RACIAL EPITHETS. IN MY VIEW, AND I HAVEN'T SEARCHED FOR EMPIRICAL DATA ON THIS ISSUE OR READ ANY STUDIES ON THIS ISSUE, BUT I BELIEVE AND THIS CERTAINLY APPLIES TO ME AND IT APPLIES TO FRIENDS OF MINE WHO ARE ALSO AFRICAN AMERICANS, I BELIEVE THAT WHEN WE HEAR THIS WORD CERTAIN IMAGES COME TO MIND, PERHAPS NOT THEN, BUT PERHAPS LATER.IT ALWAYS CAUSES ME TO REFLECT ON THE FIRST TIME I WAS EVER CALLED THAT WORD. I REMEMBER IT TODAY AS CLEAR AS A BELL AND IF YOU READ SOME OF THE ARTICLES I HANDED THE COURT YESTERDAY, YOU WILL SEE THAT THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE, OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERVIEWED AND DOCUMENTED IN THOSE STUDIES AND REPORTS, OLD PEOPLE, OLDER THAN YOU, SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES, AND IN THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES, AND THEY ALL REMEMBER THE DAY, THE FIRST TIME SOMEBODY USED THAT WORD.I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME. I'M SURE MR. COCHRAN REMEMBERS THE FIRST TIME. AND WHENEVER I REFLECT BACK ON THAT, THAT EXPERIENCE, I FIND IT EXTREMELY UPSETTING AND I PROBABLY APPEAR TO BE GETTING A LITTLE UPSET RIGHT NOW AS I ADDRESS THE COURT. IT IS PROBABLY THE MOST NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.AND WHEN THE JURY HEARS THAT WORD FROM A WHITE POLICE OFFICER, THEY ARE GOING TO REFLECT ALSO I THINK ON THE MOST NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE IN THEIR LIFE, AND I THINK THAT THIS -- OR RATHER THE FIRST TIME THAT THEY HEARD THAT WORD WILL PROBABLY BE THE MOST NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE AND I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO BECOME EMOTIONAL.ANOTHER THING HEARING THAT WORD CAUSES BLACK PEOPLE TO DO, AFRICAN AMERICANS TO DO, IS IT CAUSES -- IT CAUSES YOU TO CHANGE YOUR FOCUS. IT DIVERTS YOUR ATTENTION. IF WE REALLY WANT THE JURY'S ATTENTION FOCUSED ON THE EVIDENCE AND ON THE LEGAL AND FACTUAL ISSUES, THE IMPORTANT LEGAL AND FACTUAL ISSUES INHERIT IN THIS CASE, WE SHOULDN'T LET THEM HEAR THIS WORD, BECAUSE IF THEY HEAR THIS WORD THEY ARE GOING TO FOCUS THEIR ATTENTION ON THE ISSUE OF RACE. THEY ARE GOING TO BE MORE CONCERNED WITH WHETHER MARK FUHRMAN IS A RACIST THAN THEY ARE WITH WHETHER THERE WAS ANY WAY, ANY POSSIBILITY, ANY CHANCE, ANY THEORY OFFERED BY THE DEFENSE TO ESTABLISH THAT MARK FUHRMAN PLANTED EVIDENCE.THAT WILL BE A FOREGONE CONCLUSION. THEY CAN JUST CHECK THAT ONE OFF. HE MUST HAVE DONE IT, HE IS A RACIST. THAT IS WHAT MR. COCHRAN WANTS THE JURY TO DO, SKIP THE EVIDENCE, FORGET THE DIRECT EXAMINATION AND THE CROSS-EXAMINATION AND THE REAL FACTUAL POINTS ESTABLISHED IN THE CASE. THE JURY IS GOING TO FIND THIS CASE ON THE BASIS OF RACE. THEY ARE GOING TO BE PREOCCUPIED WITH RACE.AFTER ALL, MR. SIMPSON IS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN AND SO IS MR. COCHRAN. THE USE OF THIS WORD CAUSES PEOPLE TO DIVERT THEIR FOCUS FROM THE REAL IMPORTANT ISSUES IN FRONT OF THEM. IT CAUSES PEOPLE TO FOCUS SOLELY ON THE ISSUE OF RACE AND THAT IS THE REASON THAT WE DON'T USE IT.NOW, I'M SURE THAT MR. COCHRAN OR DEAN UELMEN WILL STEP TO THE PODIUM AND THEY WILL SAY, JUDGE, YOUR HONOR, YOU CAN ALWAYS ISSUE SOME LIMITING INSTRUCTION. YOU CAN SAY TO ALL THE BLACK JURORS HERE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE USE OF THE ""N"" WORD HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN THIS CASE FOR A LIMITED PURPOSE AND THIS IS THE PURPOSE AND DON'T CONSIDER IT FOR ANY OTHER REASON.THAT IS POINTLESS. IT IS A WASTE OF PAPER AND A WASTE OF THE COURT'S TIME BECAUSE YOU CAN'T IGNORE IT. ONCE THAT WORD IS IN FRONT OF YOU, YOU CAN'T IGNORE IT. I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO IGNORE THIS WORD OVER THE LAST WEEK WHEN I SUDDENLY FOUND MYSELF INVOLVED IN THIS NASTY LITTLE ISSUE, ARGUING THIS ISSUE, THE USE OF THE ""N"" WORD IN THIS CASE.WELL, IT POSES AN IMPORTANT MORAL QUESTION FOR ME PERSONALLY BECAUSE MY BELIEF IS, HEY, IF YOU SEE A RACIST, LET'S TATTOO IT ON HIS FOREHEAD SO EVERYBODY KNOWS WHEN THEY MEET THE GUY THAT, HEY, HE IS A RACIST. AND I AM NOT SAYING MARK FUHRMAN IS A RACIST, BECAUSE I HAVE MET MARK FUHRMAN AND I HAVE TALKED TO MARK FUHRMAN.AND I HAVE LOOKED AT THESE RECORDS, AND WHAT I SEE IN THE RECORD IS THAT IN 1981 AND 1982 MARK FUHRMAN SUFFERED FROM STRESS. HE SUFFERED FROM THE SAME KIND OF STRESS THAT LOTS OF POLICE OFFICERS SUFFER FROM, NOT JUST WHITE POLICE OFFICERS, BUT BLACK POLICE OFFICERS AS WELL.I THINK THE RECORDS ARE CLEAR THAT DURING THOSE DAYS THAT MARK FUHRMAN HAD BEEN SHOT AT FOR NO REASON OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT HE WAS AN LAPD OFFICER. HIS FRIEND HAD BEEN SHOT AT, HIS COLLEAGUES HAD BEEN KILLED. PEOPLE WOULD SPIT ON HIM JUST BECAUSE HE WORE A BLUE UNIFORM. PEOPLE HAD DIRECTED RACIAL EPITHETS TOWARD HIM.HE HAD JUST COME BACK FROM VIETNAM WHEN HE JOINED THE LAPD. HE WAS SUFFERING FROM STRESS AND IT HAS TO BE STRESSFUL TO BE A POLICE OFFICER IN THE CITY OF L.A. I MEAN, GEEZ, THE STUFF THAT IS GOING ON IN THIS CITY IN THE LAST FIVE TO SIX YEARS, I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYBODY THAT WOULD WANT A JOB LIKE THAT, BUT SOME DO AND THEY OUGHT TO BE COMMENDED.BUT THE POINT I'M ATTEMPTING TO MAKE IS THAT THERE IS NO LIMITING INSTRUCTION THAT THE COURT CAN GIVE TO ORDER THE JURY OR TO CAUSE THE JURY TO PLACE THE USE OF THIS TERM INTO SOME PERSPECTIVE OTHER THAN THE ONE THEY HAVE ALWAYS PLACED IT IN AND THAT IS AT THE TOP OF THE LIST, NO. 1. NO. 1 IN THE CATEGORY OF THE MOST OFFENSIVE EMOTIONAL TERMS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.IT IS THE PROSECUTION'S POSITION THAT IF YOU ALLOW MR. COCHRAN TO USE THIS WORD AND TO PLAY THIS RACE CARD, NOT ONLY DOES THE DIRECTION AND THE FOCUS OF THE CASE CHANGE, BUT THE ENTIRE COMPLEXION OF THE CASE CHANGES. IT IS A RACE CASE THEN. IT IS WHITE VERSUS BLACK, AFRICAN AMERICAN VERSUS CAUCASIAN, US VERSUS THEM, US VERSUS THE SYSTEM.IT IS NOT A SIMPLE ISSUE THEN OF SIMPLE GUILT OR INNOCENCE OR PROOF BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. IT BECOMES AN ISSUE OF COLOR. WHO IS -- YOU KNOW, WHO IS THE BLACKEST MAN UP HERE? WHO ARE THE REAL BROTHERS? WHO ARE -- WHO REALLY REPRESENTS THE AFRICAN AMERICAN INTERESTS IN THIS CASE? IT CHANGES TO ALL KIND OF OTHER THINGS.THE JURY -- THE JURY WILL FORGET ABOUT THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE. ALL THEY WILL THINK ABOUT IS FRAME-UP, FRAME-UP, FRAME-UP. THERE WON'T BE ANY EVIDENCE OF ANY FRAME, THAT THIS DEFENDANT WAS FRAMED BY ANY MEMBER OF THE LAPD. YOU KNOW, THEY MAY MAKE A WEAK ATTEMPT AT PROVING A FRAME-UP, BUT THERE WON'T BE ANY EVIDENCE. ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS MENTION THE WORD, SAY TO MARK FUHRMAN, HEY, DID YOU EVER USE THAT ""N"" WORD AND HE WILL SAY YEAH AND IT IS OVER, HE MUST HAVE PLANTED THE GLOVE.IN DIRECT EXAMINATION AND EVEN IN CROSS-EXAMINATION AND IN ALL MATTERS RELATED TO THE ISSUE, I BELIEVE, OF WHETHER EVIDENCE MIGHT BE ADMITTED AT TRIAL, THE EVIDENCE HAS TO BE RELEVANT, AND I THINK ALL EVIDENCE IS SUBJECT TO AN EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 352 OBJECTION.OKAY. DOES THE PROBATIVE VALUE OF THE EVIDENCE OR IS THE PROBATIVE VALUE OF THE EVIDENCE OUTWEIGHED BY THE PREJUDICIAL EFFECT? IS THERE SUBSTANTIAL PREJUDICE?AND I THINK MR. GOLDBERG YESTERDAY ALLUDED TO THE FACT THAT IT IS EVEN AND THIS ISN'T EVEN -- WHAT DID MR. GOLDBERG SAY? IF IT IS EVEN -- I BELIEVE WE WIN IF IT IS EVEN.BUT IN THIS SITUATION THE PREJUDICE THAT WILL FLOW TO THE PEOPLE'S CASE BECAUSE OF THE INFLAMMATORY NATURE OF THAT WORD IS BEYOND -- BEYOND SUBSTANTIAL PREJUDICE. IT IS EXTREME PREJUDICE. IT IS PREJUDICE AT THE MOST EXTREME. WE CAN'T WIN, NO MATTER WHAT, BECAUSE NOW WE ARE TRYING A RACE CASE. WE ARE NOT TRYING O.J. SIMPSON AND WE ARE NOT TRYING THE ISSUE OF WHETHER HE KILLED TWO PEOPLE ON BUNDY ON JUNE 12. WE ARE TRYING A RACE CASE.AND EVERYTHING, EVERY PIECE OF EVIDENCE, EVERY WITNESS, EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN THIS CASE BEYOND THAT IS GOING TO SOMEHOW BE AFFECTED BY THE JURY'S PERCEPTION OF THAT WITNESS' ETHNICITY AND COLOR AND THE REAL ISSUES IN THIS CASE ARE GOING TO BE PAINTED, GLOSSED OVER, MISSED BY THE JURY AND COMPLETELY IGNORED.NOW, THE COURT MAY WELL THINK, WELL, MR. DARDEN, THIS IS AN AWFUL EXTREME ARGUMENT THAT YOU ARE MAKING, BUT IT IS TRUE. THAT IS WHAT THIS WORD DOES, YOUR HONOR. THAT IS WHAT THIS WORD DOES. AND TO COME FROM A WHITE POLICE OFFICER, THAT JUST EXACERBATES EVERYTHING.WHAT HAPPENED TO MARK FUHRMAN FOURTEEN YEARS AGO UNDER THE -- UNDER THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH THESE STATEMENTS WERE ALLEGEDLY MADE, WHILE SUFFERING APPARENTLY FROM SOME FORM OF STRESS, A POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS AND AFTER HIS WIFE LEFT HIM, IT IS UNFAIR.IT IS UNFAIR TO INTRODUCE THE STATEMENTS IN THIS CASE. THEY ARE INHERENTLY UNRELIABLE AND IT IS UNFAIR TO ALLOW MR. COCHRAN TO PLAY THE RACE CARD AND MAKE AND TURN THESE PROCEEDINGS INTO A RACE CASE.IF I HAVEN'T STRENUOUSLY OBJECTED ALREADY TO THE NOTION THAT THIS WORD SHOULD NOT BE ADMITTED IN THE COURT, THEN LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR; I DO.ALL THE PROSECUTION WANTS IN THIS CASE IS A FAIR SHOT, A FAIR TRIAL. WE JUST WANT EVERYBODY TO PLAY BY THE RULES, AND WHEN WE DON'T PLAY BY THE RULES AND WHEN THERE IS A PERCEPTION THAT WE DON'T PLAY BY THE RULES, THE COURT SANCTIONS US, DEAN UELMEN BERATES US AND WE DO WHAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO DO.THE RULES DON'T REQUIRE THE COURT TO ALLOW THE USE OF THIS WORD INTO THIS COURTROOM OR TO HAVE THIS WORD UTTERED INTO THIS COURTROOM.AND WE STRONGLY URGE THE COURT, AND RESPECTFULLY SO, THAT THE COURT NOT ALLOW THAT WORD, THAT IT NOT BE UTTERED IN THIS COURTROOM.

#MR. COCHRAN: ,"THANK YOU VERY MUCH, JUDGE ITO.I HAVE A FUNERAL TO ATTEND TODAY, BUT THERE IS FEW THINGS IN LIFE MORE IMPORTANT THAN ATTENDING THE FUNERAL OF SOMEONE WHO IS DEPARTED WHERE YOU HAVE BEEN ASKED TO SPEAK, BUT I WOULD BE REMISS WERE I NOT AT THIS TIME TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO MY GOOD FRIEND, MR. CHRIS DARDEN.HIS REMARKS THIS MORNING ARE PERHAPS THE MOST INCREDIBLE REMARKS I'VE HEARD IN A COURT OF LAW IN THE 32 YEARS I HAVE BEEN PRACTICING LAW. HIS REMARKS ARE DEMEANING TO AFRICAN AMERICANS AS A GROUP.AND SO I WANT, BEFORE I GO TO THIS FUNERAL, TO APOLOGIZE TO AFRICAN AMERICANS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. NOT EVERY AFRICAN AMERICAN FEELS THAT WAY. IT IS DEMEANING TO OUR JURORS TO SAY THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO HAVE LIVED UNDER OPPRESSION FOR 200 PLUS YEARS IN THIS COUNTRY CANNOT WORK WITHIN THE MAINSTREAM, CANNOT HEAR THESE OFFENSIVE WORDS.AFRICAN AMERICANS LIVE WITH OFFENSIVE WORDS, OFFENSIVE LOOKS, OFFENSIVE TREATMENT EVERY DAY OF THEIR LIVES, BUT YET THEY STILL BELIEVE IN THIS COUNTRY. AND TO SAY THAT OUR JURORS, BECAUSE THEY HEAR THIS OFFENSIVE WORD -- EVERY DAY THAT PEOPLE CALL, THAT THEY INTERACT WITH PEOPLE, WE HAVE HEARD THIS IN THE QUESTIONNAIRES -- TO SAY THEY CAN'T BE FAIR IS ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS FOR THE PROSECUTION TO STAND HERE AND OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS TO PRESENT CHARACTER ASSASSINATION AGAINST THIS MAN, UNFOUNDED, BOGUS CHARGES AFTER CHARGE AFTER CHARGE, THEN TO WITHDRAW SEVENTEEN OF THOSE CHARGES, FOR THEM TO HAVE THE TEMERITY, THE UNMITIGATED GALL TO COME INTO THIS COURTROOM AND TALK ABOUT FAIRNESS.WHAT WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THIS AFTERNOON, YOUR HONOR, IS WORDS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF MARK FUHRMAN. WHAT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU ARE THE THINGS THAT THIS MAN SAID, NOT WHAT WE MADE UP, WHAT HE SAID, WHAT HE TOLD PEOPLE.AND I AM ASHAMED THAT MR. DARDEN WOULD ALLOW HIMSELF TO BECOME AN APOLOGIST FOR THIS MAN, TO JUSTIFY THE FACT HE IS A POLICE OFFICER. BEING A POLICE OFFICER IS TOUGH. BEING A LAWYER IS TOUGH. BEING A JUDGE IS TOUGH. THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU USE RACISM. YOU CAN'T JUSTIFY THAT IN A CIVILIZED SOCIETY.TO TRY AND PRETEND THAT RACISM DOESN'T EXIST IN THIS COUNTRY IS TO BURY ONE'S HEAD IN THE SAND. IT IS THE HEIGHT OF NAIVETE. NOBODY WANTS TO INTRODUCE RACE INTO THIS CASE, YOUR HONOR, BUT AS MR. DARDEN HAS POINTED OUT, RACE PLAYS A PART OF EVERYTHING IN AMERICA.WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH AFRICAN AMERICANS, WE HAVE TRIED TO RISE ABOVE THAT BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE RACISTS IN THIS COUNTRY, BUT YET WE STILL LOVE THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE WE HAVE HELPED BUILD THIS COUNTRY, SO I AM PROUD TO BE AN AFRICAN AMERICAN.BUT I DON'T WEAR THAT. I AM ALSO A LAWYER. I AM A LAWYER WHO HAPPENS TO BE AN AFRICAN AMERICAN, BUT I WILL NOT ALLOW MYSELF TO BE USED UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES TO BECOME AN APOLOGIST FOR PEOPLE WHO USE RACIST STATEMENTS IN THE PAST, TO MALIGN OTHER AFRICAN AMERICANS, TO SAY THAT I'M SOME EXPERT TO COME HERE AND TESTIFY AS AN EXPERT AS TO WHAT BLACK PEOPLE THINK IN AMERICA.ALL ACROSS AMERICA TODAY, BELIEVE ME, BLACK PEOPLE ARE OFFENDED AT THIS VERY MOMENT, AND SO I HAVE TO SAY THIS WAS UNCALLED FOR, IT IS UNWARRANTED AND MOST UNFORTUNATE FOR SOMEBODY THAT I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR -- AND PERHAPS HE HAS BECOME TOO EMOTIONAL ABOUT THIS.BUT LET'S STEP BACK AND SEE WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE. WHAT THE PROSECUTION SEEKS TO DO, YOUR HONOR, IS TO PRESCRIBE THE DEFENSE. IF YOU LISTEN CAREFULLY TO MISS LEWIS, AND SHE DID A FINE JOB THIS MORNING, IT WAS ALMOST AS THOUGH SHE SWITCHED PLACES WITH DEAN UELMEN.SHE TALKED TO YOUR HONOR ABOUT INCIDENTS THAT WERE TOO OLD, THE INCIDENTS -- THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO TRY THESE INCIDENTS SEPARATELY, YOU WOULD HAVE THESE SEPARATE TRIALS, HOW UNFAIR IT WOULD BE TO THE PEOPLE.THEY DIDN'T WORRY ABOUT THAT WHEN THEY PUT OUT THIS LAUNDRY LIST OF 50 INCIDENTS GOING BACK SEVENTEEN YEARS TO TRY AND MALIGN THIS MAN. WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT? OUR JURY IS SEQUESTERED. WHY DO THEY DO THAT? BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO SHAPE PUBLIC OPINION.WHATEVER MERIT THEY GOT IN THE LAST TWO DAYS, THEY ALWAYS HAVE A WAY OF SELF-DESTRUCTING. THEY WIPED IT ALL AWAY TODAY BY THEIR CONDUCT AND YOU WILL SEE THAT. THE JURY WILL BE IN ON THAT FACT, NOT OUR JURY, THE JURY THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO COURT, THE JURY OF PUBLIC OPINION, BY THAT VERY OFFENSIVE SPEECH THAT WE'VE HEARD.NOW, IN THIS REMARK -- AND WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO HERE TODAY, ALL WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS TAKE A WITNESS WHO IS A WITNESS OF THE PROSECUTION. YOUR HONOR, WE DIDN'T CREATE MARK FUHRMAN. WE TAKE WITNESSES THE WAY WE FIND THEM. WE DIDN'T TELL HIM TO GO TO THE DOCTOR AND SAY ALL THOSE THINGS THAT I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THIS AFTERNOON. WE DIDN'T TELL HIM TO SAY THOSE THINGS IN FRONT OF KATHLEEN BELL. WE DIDN'T TELL HIM TO GET INVOLVED IN THE SHOOTING WITH MR. BRITTON.AND I WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PUT THE PROSECUTION ON NOTICE THAT AS THEY ARE CONTINUING THEIR INVESTIGATION OF MR. SIMPSON, WE ARE DAILY GETTING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT MR. FUHRMAN, AND THEY SHOULD BE NOTICED THAT IF THERE IS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION COMING, WE WILL GIVE IT TO THEM AS WE GET IT, AND THEY SHOULD BE VERY MUCH AWARE OF THAT.AND SO YOUR HONOR, I HOPE I HAVE INITIALLY EXPRESSED HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS. IT IS HARD TO REMAIN CALM IN THE FACE OF WHAT WE HAVE JUST HEARD, ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE HAS DEDICATED ONE'S LIFE TRYING TO RISE ABOVE RACISM, TO TRY ACT IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER AT ALL TIMES. YOU ARE TRYING NOT TO INTERJECT ONE'S PERSONAL FEELINGS.AND SO WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT MR. COCHRAN IS GOING TO DO THIS, HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO. ALL WE ARE GOING TO DO IS CONDUCT THIS CASE FAIRLY AND HONESTLY.AND THE FINAL THING I WOULD LIKE TO SAY BEFORE WE TAKE OUR BREAK, YOUR HONOR, IT SEEMS TO ME SOMEBODY NEEDS TO SAY TO THESE PROSECUTORS THAT THE FACT THAT THEY ARE PROSECUTORS DOESN'T MEAN THEY ARE ALWAYS RIGHT. THEY DON'T HAVE ANY PRIORITY ON THE TRUTH. AND THE ARROGANCE THEY HAVE EACH SHOWN IN STANDING UP HERE AND TALKING ABOUT THIS MOUNTAIN OF EVIDENCE AND THEN COME WHINING BACK TO YOU SAYING, WELL, GEE, WE CAN'T GET A FAIR TRIAL BECAUSE JURORS ARE GOING TO BE THROWN OFF BY ONE WORD, HOW PREPOSTEROUS IS THAT?YOU WILL NOT BE SWAYED BY THAT. AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT PROFESSIONAL LAWYERS DON'T TALK IN TERMS OF WE'VE GOT ALL THIS EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM, THEY WITHDRAW IT THE NEXT DAY. THEY ARE MOUTHING.IF THEY'VE GOT SO MUCH EVIDENCE, LET THEM PRODUCE IT IN COURT AND STOP TALKING ABOUT IT AND LET'S ALL PLAY BY THE RULES, LET'S PLAY BY THE FAIR RULES HERE.AND ALL WE WANT TO DO IS HAVE OUR FAIR OPPORTUNITY. THEY, YOUR HONOR, DO NOT HAVE A RIGHT TO PRESCRIBE OUR CROSS-EXAMINATION AND WHAT THEY WOULD DO OUT OF TACTICS IS MARK FUHRMAN HAS BEEN A CENTRAL PERSON IN THIS CASE, BUT IN LISTENING TO IT THIS MORNING, YOUR HONOR, ALL OF A SUDDEN HE IS A VERY, VERY MINOR PLAYER IN THIS CASE. THEY WOULDN'T EVEN CALL HIM IF THEY DON'T WANT TO. THEY DON'T WANT TO CALL DR. GOLDEN.BUT YOUR HONOR, THEY ARE LEFT AND STUCK WITH THESE WITNESSES. WE DIDN'T CREATE THEM. AND WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY AND A DUTY TO VIGOROUSLY CROSS-EXAMINE.WHEN WE RETURN THIS AFTERNOON I WILL ASK LEAVE OF COURT TO CONTINUE MY REMARKS AND SHARE THEM WITH DEAN UELMEN. I APPRECIATE YOUR ALLOWING ME TO DO THIS BEFORE I ASK LEAVE TO GO TO THE FUNERAL.

#MR. UELMEN: ,"YOUR HONOR, I HAVE TO SAY, WHEN MR. DARDEN ASKED ME IF I WAS GOING TO USE THE ""N"" WORD, MY IMMEDIATE REACTION WAS, AFTER THE TROUBLE I HAD FOR USING THE ""F"" WORD, THERE'S NO WAY I'M GOING TO STEP INTO THAT ONE. ONE OF MY MOTHER'S FRIENDS ACTUALLY CALLED AND SUGGESTED THAT I SHOULD HAVE MY MOUTH WASHED OUT WITH SOAP.THERE REALLY IS A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MOTION IN LIMINE LIMITING THE EXAMINATION OF DETECTIVE FUHRMAN AND THE MOTION THAT YOUR HONOR NOW HAS UNDER CONSIDERATION DEALING WITH ALL OF THE CHARACTER EVIDENCE RELATING TO MR. SIMPSON; AND THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE IS THAT WHAT IS BEING ATTEMPTED HERE IS AN ATTEMPT TO LIMIT CROSS-EXAMINATION.WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT KEEPING OUT EVIDENCE FROM A CASE IN CHIEF. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PUTTING LIMITS ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH A WITNESS WILL BE CROSS-EXAMINED IN THE COURSE OF THIS TRIAL. AND THAT DIFFERENCE I THINK IS THE REAL REASON THAT THIS MOTION IS PREMATURE.WE DON'T KNOW YET WHAT THE DIRECT TESTIMONY OF DETECTIVE FUHRMAN WILL BE. WE HEARD SOME INTIMATIONS AND TALK ABOUT LAWYER'S DREAMS AND WISHES, THE DREAMS OF THE PROSECUTION TO ATTEMPTING TO LIMIT SOMEHOW DETECTIVE FUHRMAN'S TESTIMONY SO THEY CAN SCOOT HIM IN HERE AND HAVE HIM UP HERE FOR TWO MINUTES AND DESCRIBE HOW HE FOUND THE GLOVE AND LEAVE. MY REACTION WAS, ""NOT IN YOUR DREAMS.""THERE IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT THE PROSECUTION INDICATED DETECTIVE FUHRMAN WOULD NOT BE TESTIFYING ABOUT THAT WILL BE RELEVANT CROSS-EXAMINATION WITH RESPECT TO HIS DIRECT TESTIMONY NO MATTER HOW RESTRICTED THAT TESTIMONY IS.AND AS LONG AS WE'RE BOTH PUTTING EACH OTHER ON NOTICE, WE'LL PUT THE PROSECUTION ON NOTICE THAT EVEN IF THEY SUCCEED IN SO DRASTICALLY LIMITING THE TESTIMONY OF DETECTIVE FUHRMAN, HE WILL MAKE ANOTHER APPEARANCE IN THIS CASE BEING CALLED AS A HOSTILE WITNESS BY THE DEFENSE BECAUSE HE HAS A LOT OF RELEVANT TESTIMONY TO OFFER WITH RESPECT TO THE BRONCO AUTOMOBILE, THE POSITION OF THAT AUTOMOBILE, WHETHER THAT AUTOMOBILE WAS ENTERED AND MOVED BEFORE IT WAS TOWED AWAY FROM THE SCENE, LOTS OF QUESTIONS THAT ARE GOING TO COME UP WITH RESPECT TO HOW EVIDENCE WAS CONTAMINATED IN TERMS OF THE PARADE OF OFFICERS WHO WENT FROM ONE SCENE TO THE OTHER.DETECTIVE FUHRMAN IS GOING TO BE A CRUCIAL WITNESS WITH RESPECT TO A LOT OF EVIDENCE IN THIS TRIAL, AND MR. COCHRAN IS GOING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE WAYS IN WHICH THAT TESTIMONY WILL BE RELEVANT.BUT THE IMPORTANT POINT IS, WE DON'T KNOW YET WHAT HIS DIRECT TESTIMONY WILL BE. SO WE CAN'T REALLY DEFINE AT THIS POINT IN ADVANCE WHAT THE RELEVANCE OF PARTICULAR CROSS-EXAMINATION WILL BE.IT'S ALSO ALARMING THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE MOTION IS BASED ON SOME SORT OF PROGNOSTICATION OF WHAT THE DEFENSE STRATEGY IS GOING TO BE IN THIS CASE, AND WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT THAT INCLUDES A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE APPARENTLY BASED ON READING THE SPECULATION IN THE TABLOIDS AND NOT BASED ON READING ANY OF THE TRANSCRIPTS OF THE RECORD OF PROCEEDINGS IN THIS CASE IN TERMS OF WHAT IS ON THE RECORD WITH RESPECT TO DETECTIVE FUHRMAN.I AGREE WITH THE PROSECUTION THAT IT IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE TIME TO REVEAL PROSECUTION STRATEGY NOR IS IT AN APPROPRIATE TIME TO REVEAL DEFENSE STRATEGY, BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOUR HONOR NEEDS TO KNOW THAT STRATEGY IN ORDER TO RULE ON THIS MOTION, WE HAVE IN OUR RESPONSE LAID OUT 11 DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH THE CREDIBILITY OF DETECTIVE FUHRMAN WILL BE IN ISSUE IN THIS CASE.AND THE RESPONSE OR THE MOTION ITSELF AND THE ULTIMATE REPLY TO OUR RESPONSE MAKES A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE PEOPLE'S EVIDENCE IS GOING TO SHOW AS WELL IN THEIR STATEMENT THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE DEFENSE THEORY REGARDING DETECTIVE FUHRMAN, THAT HE DELIBERATELY PLANTED THIS GLOVE, THEY KNOW WHAT THIS THEORY IS AND THEY CAN SHOW YOU IN ADVANCE THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY THAT THE EVIDENCE WILL EVER SUPPORT THIS THEORY.AND THAT SIMPLY ASSUMES THAT THE OUT-OF-COURT STATEMENTS THAT THEY HAVE COLLECTED IN THE COURSE OF THEIR INVESTIGATION ARE NOT GOING TO BE REFUTED IN ANY WAY, THAT THEY'RE NOT REFUTABLE, THAT THEY CONCLUSIVELY WILL PROVE THAT THIS COULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED. AND I THINK IN THE PAPERS ITSELF RELATED TO THIS MOTION, WE'VE BEEN TREATED TO A COUPLE OF EXCELLENT EXAMPLES OF HOW FALLIBLE THAT CLAIM IS, WHAT THE REALITY IS IN TERMS OF HOW THE EVIDENCE CAN AT THIS POINT CONCLUSIVELY SHOW ANYTHING.IN THE ORIGINAL MOTION, THE PEOPLE ASSERTED THAT THE PHOTOGRAPHER WHO FINISHED PHOTOGRAPHING THE SCENE BEFORE DETECTIVE FUHRMAN EVER ARRIVED DID NOT SEE OR PHOTOGRAPH A SECOND GLOVE ANYWHERE AT THE CRIME SCENE; AND THAT IS BASED ON A FACTUAL ASSERTION IN THEIR STATEMENT OF FACTS THAT LAPD PHOTOGRAPHER RALPH ROKAR RESPONDED TO THE CRIME SCENE, TOOK NUMEROUS PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE AREA AROUND THEM INCLUDING PHOTOGRAPHS OF A SINGLE DARK LEATHER GLOVE AND HE COMPLETED ALL OF HIS OVERALL PHOTOGRAPHY AT THE CRIME SCENE BEFORE DETECTIVES PHILLIPS AND FUHRMAN ARRIVED ON THE SCENE.WELL, OUR RESPONSE TO THAT WAS, OF COURSE, WE HAVEN'T MET RALPH ROKAR YET. HE DID NOT TESTIFY AT THE PRELIMINARY HEARING. HE HAS NOT GIVEN SWORN TESTIMONY IN ANY PART OF THIS CASE YET. SO HOW DO WE KNOW WHAT HE IS GOING TO SAY WITH RESPECT TO WHEN HE ARRIVED OR WHAT PICTURES HE TOOK OR FROM WHAT VANTAGE POINTS THOSE PHOTOGRAPHS WERE TAKEN?AND THEN IN THE REPLY, WE FIND A VERY INTERESTING FOOTNOTE ON PAGE 12, FOOTNOTE 3 IN THEIR REPLY TO OUR RESPONSE, WHICH READS AS FOLLOWS:""IN OUR MOTION, WE ALSO INDICATED THAT THE CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHER ARRIVED AND PHOTOGRAPHED THE SCENE PRIOR TO DETECTIVES PHILLIPS' AND FUHRMAN' JOINT ARRIVAL. THIS WAS ERRONEOUS.""THE PHOTOGRAPHER ERRED IN HIS RECOLLECTION OF THE TIME OF HIS ARRIVAL AT BUNDY WHEN HE WAS INTERVIEWED TELEPHONICALLY FIVE AND A HALF MONTHS AFTER THE MURDERS ON NOVEMBER 22ND.""WE HAVE SINCE OBTAINED THE PHOTOGRAPHER'S LOG FOR JUNE 13TH AND HAVE LEARNED THAT HE ARRIVED AT BUNDY AT 2:50 A.M. THIS LOG IS TWO PAGES AND WAS PROVIDED TO THE DEFENSE ON JANUARY 5TH, 1995,""ONE WEEK AGO.AND I CAN ATTEST, YOUR HONOR, THAT THROUGH BOTH INFORMAL REQUESTS AND FORMAL MOTIONS, WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET HOLD OF THE PHOTOGRAPHER'S LOG FOR SIX MONTHS, AND IT WAS JUST DELIVERED LAST WEEK.AND WHAT IT SHOWS IS THAT THE ALLEGATION IN THE OPENING MOTION IS UNTRUE. SO UNTIL WE GET RALPH ROKAR ON THE WITNESS STAND AND HEAR UNDER OATH THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH ALL OF THE PICTURES WERE TAKEN, WE REALLY DON'T KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE CLAIMS OF THE DEFENSE OR THE THEORY OF THE DEFENSE, WHATEVER THAT THEORY MIGHT BE, WITH RESPECT TO THE CREDIBILITY OF DETECTIVE FUHRMAN.THE SECOND EXAMPLE WE HAVE IS THE ALLEGATION THAT FIVE DIFFERENT UNIFORMED OFFICERS AND A SERGEANT OF THE LAPD ALSO EXAMINED THE CRIME SCENE AND THEY TOO DID NOT SEE A SECOND GLOVE.NOW, I WAS ACCUSED OF INFLAMMATORY RHETORIC IN SUGGESTING THAT THE IDENTITY OF THESE DETECTIVES OR UNIFORMED OFFICERS WAS KNOWN BUT TO GOD AND THE PROSECUTION BECAUSE WE'RE TOLD THAT ALL YOU HAD TO DO IS FLIP BACK TO OUR EARLIER STATEMENT OF FACTS, AND YOU'LL FIND THEIR NAMES LISTED.AND OF COURSE, THERE'S NO REFERENCE TO THE MOVING PAPERS ITSELF TO IDENTIFYING THESE OFFICERS AS THE OFFICERS WHO WOULD TESTIFY THAT THEY EXAMINED THE SCENE AND SAW ONLY ONE GLOVE. NOT ONE OF THESE POLICE OFFICERS TESTIFIED AT THE PRELIMINARY HEARING NOR HAVE THEY TESTIFIED IN ANY SUBSEQUENT MOTION OR PROCEEDING IN THIS CASE. SO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO TESTIFY TO WITH RESPECT TO WHAT THEY OBSERVED AND WHEN THEY OBSERVED IT.IT'S INTERESTING IF WE'RE GOING TO LEARN THAT EACH OF THE UNIFORMED OFFICERS WHO ARRIVED AT THE BUNDY SCENE IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OF JUNE 13TH DID THEIR OWN LITTLE INVESTIGATION OF THE CRIME SCENE, BECAUSE WE OF COURSE ARE GOING TO CONTEND THAT HAVING AS MANY AS 50 POLICE OFFICERS WHO APPEAR ON THAT LOG AS GOING TO THE BUNDY SCENE, HAVING EACH OF THEM TRAIPSING THROUGH THE EVIDENCE AND EXAMINING WHAT WAS THERE CREATED THE PRECISE PROBLEMS THAT THE PROSECUTION IS GOING TO HAVE IN THIS CASE WITH THE OVERWHELMING CONTAMINATION OF EVIDENCE AND THE UNRELIABILITY OF THAT EVIDENCE AS A RESULT IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WERE WALKING THROUGH THE SCENE AND DISTURBING THE EVIDENCE BEFORE IT WAS ACTUALLY COLLECTED AND DOCUMENTED.BUT THE REAL POINT IS, WELL, NONE OF THESE OFFICERS HAVE YET TESTIFIED. SO WE DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT WHETHER THE DEFENSE THEORY OR THEORIES OF THE CASE ARE GOING TO BE SUPPORTED OR CHALLENGED BY THE EVIDENCE AT ALL.I THINK IT'S INTERESTING TO NOTE AT LEAST ONE OF THESE OFFICERS DOESN'T EVEN APPEAR ON THE PROSECUTION WITNESS LIST AT THIS POINT. SO FOR HIM TO BE RELIED ON IN THE MOVING PAPERS IN THE STATEMENT OF FACTS RAISES SOME QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF WHETHER THEY'RE EVEN GOING TO PRODUCE SWORN TESTIMONY FROM THAT OFFICER.THE SECOND POINT I WANT TO ADDRESS IS THE ATTEMPT IN THIS CASE TO ANALOGIZE TO THE RULE OF LAW IN PEOPLE VERSUS HALL.SOMEHOW, THE PROSECUTION SUGGESTS THE THEORY OF DETECTIVE FUHRMAN PLANTING A GLOVE, IF INDEED THAT'S GOING TO BE A THEORY PRESENTED BY THE DEFENSE IN THIS CASE, IS ANALOGOUS TO SUGGESTING THAT SOME THIRD PARTY COMMITTED THE CRIME AND THAT THE ONLY EXPLANATION FOR SUCH CONDUCT BY A POLICE OFFICER WOULD BE THAT HE WAS TRYING TO FRAME AN INNOCENT PERSON.AND THE DIFFICULTY WITH THAT ATTEMPTED ANALOGY IS THAT ONCE AGAIN, IT MAKES SOME VERY FAR-OUT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHAT MIGHT MOTIVATE AN OFFICER TO ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY PLANT EVIDENCE. AND WE SUGGESTED IN OUR PAPERS THAT THERE MAY BE A NUMBER OF PLAUSIBLE MOTIVATIONS FOR A DETECTIVE SUCH AS FUHRMAN TO WANT TO DISTURB THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE.FIRST, THAT HE MAY HAVE BEEN ANGRY THAT HE HAD BEEN KICKED OFF THE CASE.DETECTIVE FUHRMAN WAS NOT JUST A TAG-ALONG POLICE OFFICER IN THESE PROCEEDINGS. HE WAS IN CHARGE OF THIS INVESTIGATION. HE WAS THE FIRST DETECTIVE, HOMICIDE DETECTIVE TO ARRIVE AT THE BUNDY SCENE AND TAKE CHARGE OF THE INVESTIGATION; AND VERY SHORTLY THEREAFTER, HE WAS TOLD HE WAS OFF THE CASE. HE WAS BEING REASSIGNED.SECONDLY, THERE MAY HAVE BEEN MOTIVATION TO WANT TO APPEAR SOMEHOW AS THE HERO THAT SOLVED THE CASE. I MEAN, DETECTIVE FUHRMAN IS THE DETECTIVE WHO CLAIMS HE SAW THE BLOOD SPOT ON THE BRONCO, HE WENT OVER THE WALL AND THEN HE QUESTIONED KATO KAELIN AND THEN HE FOUND THE KEY PIECE OF EVIDENCE THAT BROKE THE CASE.THAT'S QUITE A ROLE FOR A DETECTIVE TO PLAY WHO HAS BEEN PULLED OFF THE CASE AND REASSIGNED.AND THIRDLY, HE MAY HAVE BEEN MOTIVATED SIMPLY BY WANTING TO PROVIDE PROBABLE CAUSE SO THAT A SEARCH WARRANT COULD BE OBTAINED TO GO INTO THE HOUSE AND LOOK FOR OTHER EVIDENCE.SO THE SCENARIO THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO PAINT OF THIS THEORY LEAVES OUT A LOT OF OTHER VERY PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATIONS THAT HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH PEOPLE VERSUS HALL.PEOPLE VERSUS HALL SAYS THAT EVIDENCE OF THIRD-PARTY CULPABILITY IS ADMISSIBLE IF IT CAN RAISE A REASONABLE DOUBT. ACTUALLY, THE HALL DECISION REJECTED THE MENENDEZ, ARLINE LINE OF CASES THAT PRECEDED IT THAT SET AN EVEN HIGHER THRESHOLD BEFORE THAT EVIDENCE COULD BE ADMITTED.BUT THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF EVIDENCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS SIMPLY QUESTIONING DETECTIVE FUHRMAN IN AREAS THAT RELATE TO HIS CREDIBILITY.AND THERE IS NO STANDARD, NO CASE THAT SAYS YOU CAN'T ASK A QUESTION OF A WITNESS ON CROSS-EXAMINATION UNLESS THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION WOULD RAISE A REASONABLE DOUBT. THAT ISN'T THE STANDARD FOR CROSS-EXAMINATION OF A WITNESS.THE STANDARD IS THE STANDARD OF RELEVANCY THAT IS CONTAINED IN SECTION 210 OF THE EVIDENCE CODE THAT SAYS:""RELEVANT EVIDENCE MEANS EVIDENCE INCLUDING EVIDENCE RELEVANT TO THE CREDIBILITY OF A WITNESS OR HEARSAY DECLARANT HAVING ANY TENDENCY IN REASON TO PROVE OR DISPROVE ANY DISPUTED FACT THAT IS OF CONSEQUENCE OR SUBSEQUENCE TO THE DETERMINATION OF THE ACT.""THAT IS THE TEST OF WHAT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN CAN BE ASKED ON CROSS-EXAMINATION; IF IT HAS ANY TENDENCY IN REASON TO PROVE OR DISPROVE WHETHER DETECTIVE FUHRMAN IS A CREDIBLE, BELIEVABLE PERSON.NOW, WITH RESPECT TO THE VARIOUS WAYS IN WHICH THE CREDIBILITY OF A WITNESS CAN BE CHALLENGED, WE RELY OF COURSE ON SECTION 780 OF THE EVIDENCE CODE WHICH LAYS OUT ALL OF THE WAYS THAT WOULD ""HAVE A TENDENCY IN REASON,"" AGAIN USING THE SAME LANGUAGE AS SECTION 210, ""TO PROVE OR DISPROVE THE TRUTHFULNESS OF A WITNESS' TESTIMONY.""AND AMONG THOSE ENUMERATED THEORIES OR BASES OF ATTACKING THE CREDIBILITY OF A WITNESS ARE THE EXISTENCE OR NONEXISTENCE OF A BIAS, INTEREST OR OTHER MOTIVE AND HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD THE ACTION IN WHICH HE TESTIFIES OR THE GIVING OF TESTIMONY.NOW, WITH RESPECT TO DETECTIVE FUHRMAN, OUR CONTENTION IS THAT WE ARE TALKING HERE ABOUT A WITNESS WITH AN ATTITUDE. IN FACT, YOU COULDN'T HAVE MORE PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF THAT ATTITUDE THAN THE LETTER THAT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN WROTE IN 1989 GIVING HIS ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAPPENED WHEN HE FIRST MET THE DEFENDANT IN 1985.AND WHAT DID HE SAY ABOUT THAT MEETING? HE SAID IT WAS INDELIBLY IMPRESSED ON HIS MEMORY. HE COULD REMEMBER FOUR YEARS LATER IN PRECISE DETAIL EVERY WORD THAT WAS SPOKEN IN THAT ENCOUNTER.AND THAT IS SOMETHING WE WANT TO EXPLORE WITH DETECTIVE FUHRMAN, JUST WHY THAT WAS INDELIBLY IMPRESSED ON HIS MEMORY, JUST WHAT HIS IMPRESSION WAS OF MR. SIMPSON AND WHETHER THOSE SAME THOUGHTS WERE GOING THROUGH THIS DETECTIVE'S MIND ON THE EVENING OR ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 13TH WHEN HE LED THE CONTINGENT OF DETECTIVES GOING TO MR. SIMPSON'S HOME TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION.NOW, WITH RESPECT TO THE 352 ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO WHETHER THE PREJUDICIAL IMPACT OF THIS EVIDENCE WOULD OUTWEIGH ITS PROBATIVE VALUE, ONCE AGAIN, WE WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ANALYSIS OF THE 352 QUESTION PRESENTED HERE WITH RESPECT TO CROSS-EXAMINATION OF DETECTIVE FUHRMAN AND THE 352 QUESTION PRESENTED TO THE COURT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO KEEP OUT EVIDENCE OF BAD CHARACTER.FIRST OF ALL, THE ELEMENT OF PREJUDICE ASSUMES TOTALLY DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE PREJUDICIAL IMPACT OF EVIDENCE ADMITTED AGAINST A CRIMINAL DEFENDANT WHOSE FATE IS GOING TO BE DECIDED BY THE JURY THAT HEARS THAT EVIDENCE. AND OF COURSE, THE PREJUDICE THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT THIS EVIDENCE WILL BE IMPROPERLY USED IN ORDER TO CONVICT SOMEONE OF A CRIME.NOW, WITH RESPECT TO DETECTIVE FUHRMAN, THE ONLY ISSUE THE JURY IS GOING TO BE DECIDING WITH RESPECT TO HIM IS WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD BELIEVE HIS TESTIMONY. AND TO SUGGEST THAT SOMEHOW THE PEOPLE WILL BE IRRETRIEVABLY PREJUDICED BECAUSE A JUROR DECIDES THEY WILL NOT CREDIT HIS TESTIMONY IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT DIMENSION OF PREJUDICE.AND THAT'S PRECISELY THE REASON WE BELIEVE THIS EVIDENCE IS RELEVANT, THAT A JURY THAT IS SIZING UP THE CREDIBILITY OF THIS WITNESS SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS EVIDENCE IN ORDER TO MAKE A RATIONAL INTELLIGENT JUDGMENT, THAT EVIDENCE SHOULD NOT BE WITHHELD FROM THEM IN TERMS OF DECIDING WHETHER DETECTIVE FUHRMAN IS A CREDIBLE OR BELIEVABLE PERSON.THE ELEMENTS OF THE UNDUE CONSUMPTION OF TIME ALSO TAKES ON A DIFFERENT DIMENSION BECAUSE WE ARE NOT TALKING AT THIS POINT ABOUT LITIGATING EACH OF THESE ALLEGATIONS OR CHARGES. WE ARE SIMPLY TALKING ABOUT CROSS-EXAMINATION. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WHETHER THESE QUESTIONS CAN BE PUT TO THE WITNESS ON CROSS-EXAMINATION.AND IT MAY BE HE HAS AN EXPLANATION OF THESE INCIDENTS AND EVENTS THAT WILL END THE MATTER AND WE WON'T EVEN NEED TO TALK ABOUT ANY COLLATERAL IMPEACHMENT. BUT YOUR HONOR CAN ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF COLLATERAL IMPEACHMENT IF AND WHEN IT COMES UP.BUT AT THIS POINT, THE ONLY QUESTION THAT YOUR HONOR HAS TO ADDRESS IS WHETHER THE DEFENSE SHOULD BE LIMITED IN ITS CROSS-EXAMINATION OF THIS WITNESS BASED ON SECTION 352.AND FINALLY, I WANT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF REMOTENESS BECAUSE THE PEOPLE HAVE MADE A SUGGESTION THAT SOMEHOW THE FIVE YEARS' PITCHESS LIMITATION ON GOING BACK INTO THE RECORDS OF A POLICE OFFICER CREATES SOME SORT OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS, SOME SORT OF TEST OF RELEVANCY THAT PROHIBITS ANY INQUIRY INTO EVENTS THAT ARE MORE THAN FIVE YEARS OLD.THE IMPETUS OF THE FIVE-YEAR LIMITATION IN PITCHESS WAS REALLY TO NOT BURDEN POLICE DEPARTMENTS WITH THE NECESSITY OF MAINTAINING RECORDS FOR MORE THAN A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD. IT DOES NOT PURPORT TO SET UP A TEST OF RELEVANCY.THE TEST OF RELEVANCY IS WHAT IS IN THE EVIDENCE CODE; AND THAT IS SIMPLY WHETHER THIS EVIDENCE HAS A TENDENCY IN REASON TO SUGGEST THAT --
","JANUARY 13, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
#MR. UELMEN: ,"-- A TENDENCY IN REASON TO SUGGEST THAT OFFICER FUHRMAN'S TESTIMONY SHOULD NOT BE BELIEVED AND UNDER SECTION 352, WHETHER THE PROBATIVE VALUE OF A PARTICULAR QUESTION IS OUTWEIGHED BY ITS POTENTIAL PREJUDICIAL IMPACT OR THE RISK OF UNDUE CONSUMPTION OF TIME.THERE OF COURSE IS AN IRONY HERE IN THE CONTEXT OF CHALLENGING MR. SIMPSON'S CREDIBILITY. THE PROSECUTION FEELS IT APPROPRIATE TO GO BACK 17 YEARS AND REQUIRE HIM TO EXPLAIN THINGS THAT HAPPENED 17 YEARS AGO, BUT THAT WE SHOULD NOT EXHAUST THE MEMORY OF A POLICE OFFICER BEYOND A FIVE-YEAR LIMITATION. AND OF COURSE, THERE'S NO BASIS IN LAW OR FACT FOR ANY SUCH ASSERTION.THE RELEVANCE OF THESE EVENTS -- AND MR. COCHRAN WILL GO INTO MORE DETAIL WITH RESPECT TO THE PARTICULAR EVIDENCE THAT WE THINK IS RELEVANT -- IS OF COURSE THAT IT IS PRECISELY CONTEMPORANEOUS WITH THE DEFINING EVENT THAT WE BELIEVE ESTABLISHES MR. FUHRMAN'S ATTITUDE AND HIS BIAS IN THIS CASE; AND THAT EVENT IS HIS ENCOUNTER WITH MR. SIMPSON IN 1985.AND IF, CONTEMPORANEOUS WITH THAT EVENT, DETECTIVE FUHRMAN IS MAKING STATEMENTS ABOUT HIS ATTITUDES TOWARD BLACK PEOPLE, IF HE IS MAKING STATEMENTS ABOUT HIS ATTITUDES TOWARDS INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE, WE BELIEVE THOSE ARE ATTITUDES THAT AFFECTED HOW HE DESCRIBED THAT INCIDENT IN 1989 AND INDEED AFFECTED HIS CONDUCT AND HIS ACTIVITY ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 13TH, 1994.WITH THAT, I WILL TURN THE PODIUM OVER TO MR. COCHRAN.
","JANUARY 13, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
#MR. COCHRAN: ,"THANK YOU VERY MUCH, DEAN UELMEN, AND GOOD AFTERNOON, JUDGE ITO, AND COLLEAGUES.YOUR HONOR, FOLLOWING UP ON WHAT MR. UELMEN SO ELOQUENTLY INDICATED, I WILL JUST AGAIN POINT TO EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 718. AND I CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE TO REMIND THIS COURT OF THIS, BUT UNDER THAT SECTION, IT TALKS ABOUT, UNDER 718, ""IF THE EXISTENCE OR NONEXISTENCE OF A BIAS, INTEREST OR OTHER MOTIVE."" IT TALKS ABOUT HIS ATTITUDE, A WITNESS' ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE ACTION IN WHICH HE TESTIFIES OR TOWARDS THE GIVING OF TESTIMONY.AND IN THIS PRESENTATION I'M GOING TO MAKE NOW, I WANT TO JUST ADDRESS WITH THE COURT SOME OF THE EVIDENCE THAT WE THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT AND VERY RELEVANT THAT BEARS UPON THE ATTITUDE OF THIS PARTICULAR WITNESS WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT.YOU KNOW, YOUR HONOR, IT'S VERY INTERESTING THAT A WITNESS WHO WAS SO INVOLVED IN THIS CASE FROM THE STANDPOINT OF BEING, AS I SAID, THE FIRST OFFICERS ON THE SCENE, PHILLIPS AND FUHRMAN -- HE MAKES THE OBSERVATION ALLEGEDLY OF THE BRONCO, HE'S THE ONE WHO IS SEEN IN THE PICTURES POINTING TOWARDS EVIDENCE, HE IS THE ONE WHO ALLEGEDLY GOES OVER TO ROCKINGHAM TO SHOW THE WAY TO VANNATTER, HE'S THE ONE THAT IS SO PHYSICALLY FIT THAT HE CLIMBS OVER THE WALL, HE'S THE ONE WHO ENGAGES KATO KAELIN, HE'S THE ONE WHO HAS THIS RUSH OF ADRENALIN AS HE GOES BACK DOWN THIS DARK PATH AS WE SAT WITH STILLED ATTENTION AS HE MADE THIS AMAZING DISCOVERY AND THEN WENT BACK ONE BY ONE AND SHOWED ALL THE OTHER OFFICERS, THIS IS THE SAME MAN THAT THEY NOW SAY IS INSIGNIFICANT IN THIS CASE, THEY WOULD RATHER NOT CALL HIM.NOW, WHY WOULD THE PROSECUTION COME HERE AND SAY THAT TO YOUR HONOR, AN EXPERIENCED JURIST? WELL, ONE OF THE REASONS MIGHT BE, IF WE TAKE THE DECLARATION OF KATHLEEN BELL, WHOM THEY'VE MALIGNED --NOW THIS IS A LADY, A WITNESS WHO HAS NO AX TO GRIND IN THIS AT ALL, WHO COMES FORWARD VOLUNTARILY. SHE DOESN'T PREFER ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER. SHE DOESN'T KNOW O.J. SIMPSON. SHE JUST SPELLS OUT SOMETHING BECAUSE SHE SEES WHAT SHE BELIEVES IS A WRONG.LET ME SHARE WITH YOU, JUDGE, WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY THAT WE THINK IS VERY RELEVANT AND BEARS ON THIS MAN'S ATTITUDE AND IN SPECIFIC GOES BACK TO MR. FUHRMAN'S ENCOUNTER WITH O.J. SIMPSON AND HIS WIFE BACK IN 1985.SHE SAYS THAT:""I WAS INTRODUCED TO MARK FUHRMAN BY A MARINE CORPS RECRUITER. DURING OUR INITIAL CONVERSATION, MARK FUHRMAN TOLD ME HE WAS A FORMER MARINE AND CURRENTLY A LOCAL POLICE OFFICER.""DURING OUR CONVERSATION, MARK FUHRMAN STATED THAT HE WOULD PULL OVER ANY VEHICLE THAT WAS OCCUPIED BY A BLACK MAN AND A WHITE WOMAN.""I THEN ASKED HIM, 'WHAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A GOOD REASON TO PULL THEM OVER?'""MR. FUHRMAN THEN STATED, 'I'D MAKE ONE UP.'""I THEN ASKED FUHRMAN, 'WHAT IF THE TWO PEOPLE ARE IN LOVE?'""FUHRMAN THEN APPEARED TO BE DISGUSTED WITH ME AND STATED, IF I HAD MY WAY, THEY WOULD TAKE ALL THE --'""AND I'LL USE THE WORD BECAUSE I'M QUOTING HIM --""'--ALL THE NIGGERS, PUT THEM TOGETHER IN A BIG GROUP AND BURN THEM.'""I BECAME VISIBLY UPSET, BEGAN TO CRY AND LEFT THE OFFICE.""AND TO MS. CHERI LEWIS, WHO DID A FINE JOB IN HER PRESENTATION, SOME PEOPLE WOULD CRY WHEN YOU'RE TOLD THAT A PERSON HAS AN ATTITUDE IN THIS DAY AND AGE, THEY WOULD PUT A RACIAL GROUP TOGETHER IN A GROUP AND BURN THEM. SOME PEOPLE MIGHT GET MAD. SOME PEOPLE MIGHT GET DISGUSTED. SOME PEOPLE MIGHT CRY.THIS LADY CRIED. BUT SHE WAS MALIGNED BECAUSE SHE CRIED BECAUSE OF HER SENSITIVITY.AND SHE WENT ON TO SAY:""I DO HEREBY DECLARE UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY THAT THE FOREGOING STATEMENT IS TRUE AND CORRECT.""SHE GOES ON. AND THIS LADY CAME FORWARD VOLUNTARILY.NOW, YOUR HONOR, WE THINK THAT'S VERY RELEVANT.AND SPECIFICALLY, IN 1985, THIS DETECTIVE FUHRMAN COMES OUT IN AN ALLEGED ENCOUNTER INVOLVING MR. SIMPSON AND HIS WIFE. MR. SIMPSON IS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN. HIS WIFE IS CAUCASIAN. THIS OFFICER DOESN'T WRITE A REPORT THEN, JUDGE. FOUR YEARS LATER, HE WRITES A REPORT IN 1989 WHERE HE SAYS THIS EVENT MADE AN INDELIBLE IMPRESSION UPON HIM.WE HAVE A RIGHT TO ASK ABOUT HIS ATTITUDES, ABOUT HIS MOTIVE, ABOUT HIS INTEREST, ABOUT HIS BIAS.BUT THAT'S NOT ALL, JUDGE. LET'S LOOK AT SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THIS MAN HAS SAID AND HOW IT BEARS UPON THIS EVIDENCE.THIS IS A GENTLEMAN WHO THEY TALK ABOUT BEING A POLICE OFFICER. AND WE KNOW POLICE WORK IS TOUGH WORK. BUT AS I SAID EARLIER, MUCH OF THE WORK IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS TOUGH, JUDGE. WE'RE IN IT, WE GET PAID WELL FOR WHAT WE DO, AND IF WE CAN'T BE IN IT, WE TRY TO GET OUT.NOW, THIS OFFICER DID IN FACT TRY TO GET OUT BECAUSE -- AND I WOULD LIKE TO ALLUDE, SO COUNSEL WILL HAVE IT, TO THE REPORT OF DR. HOCHMAN.NOW, THIS REPORT IS DATED DECEMBER 16, 1981 AND IT REGARDS MARK FUHRMAN. AND I'LL SKIP THE IRRELEVANT PORTIONS AND LET'S GET TO ON PAGE 8. HERE'S WHAT HE TOLD DR.

BRITTON -- AND I DON'T THINK HE MAKES ANY BONES ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE WAS CONVICTED OF A ROBBERY -- BUT WHAT HE CONTENDS WAS THAT HE WAS WRONGFULLY SHOT AND THAT THERE WERE ONLY TWO OFFICERS WHO SHOT, THAT WAS DETECTIVE FUHRMAN AND HIS PARTNER, AND THAT SOME EVIDENCE, A KNIFE, WAS MOVED CLOSER TO HIS BODY FROM WHERE HE DROPPED IT. HE'S NOT SURE WHICH OF THE TWO DID IT. AND IT WAS ONE OF THOSE TWO, AND THEY'RE BOTH DEFENDANTS AS I UNDERSTAND THE TESTIMONY.NOW, I EARLIER SAID TO THE PROSECUTION, THIS IS, AS WITH THEIR CASE, AN ON-GOING MATTER AND THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE OTHER EVIDENCE, OTHER INSTANCES OF A MORE CURRENT VARIETY THAT WE WILL SHARE WITH THEM AS SOON AS THE INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN COMPLETED.THE PROSECUTION IN THEIR PRESENTATION SPENT FAR TOO MUCH TIME ON THE GLOVE, THE PLACING OF THE GLOVE, THE MOVING OF THE GLOVE. WHAT I WOULD CHOOSE TO DO IS TO TALK WHY WE SHOULD NOT BE PRESCRIBED IN OUR CROSS-EXAMINATION.THROUGHOUT ALL, THEY'VE TRIED TO PREDICT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. THIS MOTION IS PREMATURE. MR. DARDEN DOESN'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO AS YOU COULD TELL THIS MORNING WHEN HE GETS ALL EMOTIONAL ABOUT THAT. HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO. THAT'S THEIR PROBLEM, AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO TELL THEM WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO. IT'S THEIR CASE, AND WHEN WE GET TO OUR CASE, WE'LL DEAL WITH IT, YOUR HONOR.BUT CERTAINLY WITH REGARD TO THESE ITEMS, AS I MENTIONED BEFORE, THE 1985 INCIDENT, WHO COULD ARGUE THAT WHEN THIS ENCOUNTER WAS HAD AND THE REPORT WAS WRITTEN SOME FOUR YEARS LATER, THAT'S VERY, VERY RELEVANT. SO I THINK WITH 1 AND 2, THE COURT CAN SEE EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN THAT REGARD.AND THEN WITH NUMBER 3, THE CREDIBILITY OF THE ACCOUNT, OF THE REASONS WHY THESE DETECTIVES WENT TO THE HOME. CERTAINLY WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT ILLEGAL SEARCH AND SEIZURE AT THIS POINT, YOUR HONOR. YOU RULED ON THAT.BUT I WOULD SAY THIS. THAT IT'S ABSOLUTELY RELEVANT IN THE SITUATION WHERE -- DETECTIVE VANNATTER SAID THAT HE WORKED WEST LOS ANGELES, KNEW THAT AREA. WHY THEN DID FUHRMAN AND PHILLIPS HAVE TO GO OVER TO THE RESIDENCE?I THINK THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ISSUES OF POSSIBLE IMPEACHMENT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. IF HE WORKED THERE, YOU DIDN'T NEED ANY GUIDE OVER THERE.REMINDS ME OF THE STORY, HOW MANY LAPD DETECTIVES DOES IT TAKE TO NOTIFY THE NEXT OF KIN? APPARENTLY ALL FOUR OF THEM, BECAUSE THEY ALL WENT OVER THERE, YOUR HONOR, AND FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY DID.THE CREDIBILITY OF THIS DESCRIPTION OF THE POSITION OF THE DEFENDANT'S FORD BRONCO; AGAIN, THIS IS AN IMPORTANT WITNESS. AND WHETHER THAT VEHICLE WAS PARKED ASKEW AND AT WHAT TIME, WAS THAT VEHICLE MOVED BY SOME OFFICER, WAS IT LOCKED, WHO GOT IN THERE AND WHO MOVED IT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, WHETHER OR NOT THE VEHICLE WAS SECURE AT THE TIME.AND THOSE ARE ALL I MEAN REAL ISSUES IN THIS CASE, JUDGE, THAT WE WILL BE LITIGATING MOST VIGOROUSLY.THE DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THE ACCOUNT OF THIS PARTICULAR OFFICER REGARDING THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS AT THE ROCKINGHAM ADDRESS. AS THE COURT IS AWARE, THAT WE'RE NOW AWARE OF THE WESTEC OFFICERS WHO ARRIVED AND THAT SORT OF THING. SO THAT WE HAVE AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO GO INTO THEIR CREDIBILITY AND THEIR TESTIMONY UNDER OATH WITH REGARD TO THOSE EVENTS, WHAT LED THEM THERE AND WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THEY GOT THERE.DID THEY GO THERE MORE THAN ONE TIME THAT MORNING? THOSE WILL BE THINGS WE WILL BE QUERYING, YOUR HONOR.AND THEN OF COURSE THE CREDIBILITY OF THE TESTIMONY REGARDING THE DISCOVERY OF THE SPOTS OF BLOOD SUPPOSEDLY ON THE FORD BRONCO AND THE DRIVEWAY OF ROCKINGHAM.TO HEAR THE PROSECUTION, OF COURSE, THAT'S NO LONGER IMPORTANT AND THEY WOULDN'T EVEN BOTHER TALKING ABOUT THAT.THE SEARCH OF KATO KAELIN'S ROOM AGAIN IS A QUESTION OF THIS MAN'S CREDIBILITY. HE IS THERE TO NOTIFY MR. SIMPSON. FIRST THING HE DOES IS START LOOKING THROUGH CLOTHES, LOOKING AT MR. KATO KAELIN'S EYES, LOOKING AT HIS SHOES. HOW DOES THAT BEAR UPON NOTIFYING ANYONE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES?BUT YET THAT IS THE SAME OFFICER, THE SAME OFFICER WHO NO LONGER WANTED TO BE A POLICE OFFICER.AND I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT THOSE ARGUMENTS THAT HE MADE TO TRY TO GET OUT OF BEING A POLICE OFFICER WERE ALL REJECTED BY THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES.WHAT DOES THAT TELL US?HE SAYS:""I HAVE THESE TERRIBLE PROBLEMS. I WANT TO GET OUT.""THEY SAY:""YOU'RE LYING. WE'RE NOT LETTING YOU OUT. YOU ARE GOING TO REMAIN A POLICE OFFICER.""IS CREDIBILITY AT ISSUE, YOUR HONOR? I THINK SO.SO THE CREDIBILITY OF HIS ACCOUNT, OF HIS PARTICIPATION, THE EXECUTION OF THESE SEARCH WARRANTS, NOT THE SEARCH WARRANT ITSELF, BUT THE CREDIBILITY OF THE INFORMATION GIVEN, YOUR HONOR, WE ARE PERMITTED TO GO INTO THOSE FACTS.WE'VE SEEN WITH THE OTHER WITNESSES THERE'S BEEN A RECKLESS DISREGARD FOR THE TRUTH, AND WE ARE PERMITTED IT SEEMS TO ME TO LOOK AT THOSE ITEMS, OF THE RECKLESS DISREGARD FOR THE TRUTH FROM ANY OF THESE WITNESSES WHO HAVE DONE THAT.AND THEN BECAUSE OF HIS FAILURE TO RECORD, RECORDS WE HEAR FROM MISS LEWIS THIS MORNING, HE HAD SOME BRIEF NOTES. WELL, THIS IS THIS IMPORTANT WITNESS THEY PARADE OUT. HE HAS ONLY BRIEF NOTES OR LACK OF NOTES OR VERY FEW NOTES?IF IT WAS NOT HIS CASE ANYMORE, WHAT WAS HE DOING OVER THERE? WHY WAS HE THE ONE TAKING THE ACTIVE ROLE? VANNATTER DIDN'T BECOME ACTIVE UNTIL MUCH LATER IT SEEMED IN THE DAY IF THE COURT PLEASES.HIS ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITY, THE FAILURE OF THE OFFICERS TO FOLLOW PROPER TECHNIQUES TO PRESERVE EVIDENCE WITHOUT CONTAMINATION. AND AGAIN, WITHOUT AGAIN GOING INTO THE EVIDENCE, YOU WILL SEE PICTURES OF THE VARIOUS OFFICERS AT THE SCENE, PICTURES OF MARK FUHRMAN AROUND THIS CRITICAL EVIDENCE.THE QUESTION IS, HAS THAT EVIDENCE BEEN MOVED? CAN WE DEMONSTRATE FOR THIS COURT AND FOR THIS JURY THAT EVIDENCE, CERTAINLY OTHER THAN THE GLOVE, HAD BEEN MOVED, THE SCENE HAS BEEN TAMPERED WITH, THAT PEOPLE HAVE WALKED THROUGH BLOOD MAKING FOOTPRINTS?CAN WE SHOW THOSE THINGS? I THINK WE CAN SHOW THOSE THINGS. I THINK HE AGAIN BECOMES VERY, VERY IMPORTANT IN THAT REGARD BECAUSE HE'S ONE OF THE FIRST ONES THERE.AND HIS TESTIMONY AT THE PRELIMINARY HEARING, REFERRING TO THE GLOVES AT THE BUNDY SCENE AS ""THEM"".AND IT'S INTERESTING. MISS LEWIS AGAIN, BEING HONEST ABOUT IT, SAYS THERE'S AMBIGUITY THERE. THERE'S AMBIGUITY. HE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE GLOVES. BUT HE SAYS ""THE GLOVES"" AND HE SAYS ""THEM"".NOW, SHE SAYS, WELL, GEE, PROFESSOR UELMEN DIDN'T GO INTO THAT. BUT, YOUR HONOR, HE WAS THE PROSECUTION WITNESS. IF THERE WAS AMBIGUITY, WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IS IT TO CLEAR IT UP? IT'S THEIR RESPONSIBILITY. NOT MR. -- NOT PROFESSOR UELMEN'S.SO IT WASN'T HIS OBLIGATION. BUT THAT'S AGAIN SOMETHING WE WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE LOOKING AT.AND SO WHEN THE COURT TIES THOSE VARIOUS INCIDENTS INTO 718 OF THE EVIDENCE CODE, IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT BECOMES CLEAR THAT WHAT THE PROSECUTION IS SEEKING TO DO IS TO PRESCRIBE US IN ADVANCE, TO STOP US IN ADVANCE FROM CROSS-EXAMINATION.AND THE COURT UNDERSTANDS THE VERY IMPORTANCE OF CROSS-EXAMINATION. WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS THE ABILITY TO TRY TO GET A FAIR TRIAL.AND THIS COURT ALWAYS HAS HAD THAT CONCERN AND HAS ALSO DEMONSTRATED THAT CONCERN, THAT BOTH SIDES GET A FAIR TRIAL. YOU HAVE BEEN PATIENT, OFTEN TIMES BEYOND BELIEF AS THE LAWYERS HAVE GONE ON AND ON. AND I'M MINDFUL OF THAT AS WE GET CLOSE TO 3:00 O'CLOCK.BUT AT THE TIME, CROSS-EXAMINATION IS NOT ONE OF THESE THINGS WHERE I DON'T THINK -- I THINK THIS COURT WOULD WANT TO DEPRIVE ANYONE OF, CERTAINLY IN ADVANCE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.AND AS DEAN UELMEN HAS SAID, IT IS THE HEIGHT OF IRONY AND HYPOCRISY TO SPEND TWO DAYS ON GOING BACK IN THIS MAN'S LIFE 17, 18 YEARS AGO ON THINGS HE COULD HARDLY EVEN REMEMBER, MYSTERIOUS PEOPLE WHO APPEAR ALL OF A SUDDEN WITHOUT BEING CHECKED, FROM THIS KIND OF TABLOID PROSECUTION, WHERE THEY GET THEIR WITNESSES FROM HARD COPY, COME IN AND MAKE A NATIONAL DISPLAY AND THEN HAVE TO WITHDRAW 18 OF THOSE WITNESSES. I MEAN IT'S OUTRAGEOUS.AND THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT BEING FAIR. FAIR WORKS BOTH WAYS. FAIR WORKS BOTH WAYS. AND WHAT WE MEAN BY FAIRNESS, WE WANT THE ABILITY TO CROSS-EXAMINE THESE WITNESSES.SO IF THEY HAVE A KEY WITNESS, THEY CAN'T HIDE THAT WITNESS. THIS IS A MOTION TO HIDE DETECTIVE FUHRMAN, AND HE CAN'T BE -- HE CAN'T HIDE, JUDGE, YOUR HONOR. HIS WORDS ARE OUT THERE.AND THAT BRINGS ME TO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT THIS MORNING AGAIN JUST BRIEFLY.WE TAKE THE FACTS THE WAY WE FIND THEM. WE'RE ON THE EVE OF TRIAL. IT'S TIME TO STOP TALKING AND POSTULATING. LET'S GO TO TRIAL.ON THE ONE HAND, THEY WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT MOUNTAINS OF EVIDENCE THEY HAVE. ON THE OTHER HAND, OUT THE OTHER SIDE OF HIS MOUTH, HE SAYS, BUT GEE, IT WON'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE CAN'T BE FAIR, MALIGNING THESE PEOPLE. I MEAN IN THE COOL LIGHT OF DAY, WE SEE ERRORS IN HIS CASE IN THAT REGARD.THAT WAS WRONG TO DO. THAT WE CAN ALL BECOME EMOTIONAL, BUT AS OFFICERS OF THIS COURT, I HOPE WE CAN ALL REMEMBER TO BE PROFESSIONAL.WE HAVE TO DECIDE THIS CASE BASED UPON THE EVIDENCE. WE DIDN'T MAKE THESE FACTS UP. AND THEIR JOB IS TO SEEK JUSTICE. OUR JOB IS TO DEFEND OUR CLIENT, AS THE COURT IS AWARE. AND IN THE PURSUIT OF JUSTICE WE'RE CAUGHT UP WITH, SOMETIMES WE LOSE SIGHT OF OUR PERSPECTIVE.THERE WILL BE LIFE AFTER SIMPSON FOR ALL OF US. I THINK WE NEED TO ALL REMEMBER THAT.SO, YOUR HONOR, I THINK THAT THESE INCIDENTS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BEAR UPON THE CREDIBILITY OF THIS OFFICER'S TESTIMONY. NOT JUST ABOUT THE GLOVE, BUT BEARS UPON HIS ATTITUDES, HIS BELIEFS, HIS THOUGHT PROCESSES.AND THAT SHAPES HOW HE TESTIFIES. IF HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE PEOPLE HE SERVES, WE HAVE A RIGHT TO BRING THAT OUT. AND THEY HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT BECAUSE THAT'S THE TESTIMONY, IF HE TESTIFIES TO THAT.IF THEY DON'T CALL HIM, WE'LL CALL HIM BECAUSE HE HAPPENED TO BE THERE. AND THEY CAN'T HIDE HIM UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES.AND THAT'S ALL WE ARE TRYING TO DO AND THAT'S WHAT THIS MOTION IS ABOUT. SO I WOULD URGE YOUR HONOR --AND OF COURSE, I THANK YOUR HONOR FOR ALLOWING US THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THOROUGHLY DISCUSS THIS. THIS IS NOT BY ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION A 352 PROBLEM.AND ONE FINAL THING THAT I THINK THAT I MUST ADDRESS.PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS THROWING OUT THIS THING ABOUT USING THE RACE CAR AND THAT SORT OF STUFF. I'M NOT ABOUT TO USE ANY RACE CAR. ALL THE DEFENSE IS TRYING TO DO IS GET JUSTICE FOR OUR CLIENT. THAT'S ALL WE ARE TRYING TO DO.AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE RACE CAR, HOW OUTRAGEOUS IS IT TO SAY THAT I'M NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT MR. SIMPSON'S FETISH FOR BLOND WHITE WOMEN THAT WAS SAID IN THIS COURT A LOT? DID I HEAR THAT? THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS.IF THIS MAN LOVED SOMEBODY WHO WAS PURPLE, IN AMERICA, HE HAS THE RIGHT TO GET MARRIED TO THAT PERSON. HIS FIRST WIFE WAS AFRICAN AMERICAN.THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF AMERICA. THAT'S WHY PEOPLE HAVE DIED, BECAUSE YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT SUPPOSEDLY. EVEN IN THIS SOCIETY THAT'S NOT PERFECT, YOU HAVE THAT RIGHT. THAT'S ALL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.THANK YOU VERY MUCH, YOUR HONOR.

#MS. CLARK: ,"THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.I'M CONCERNED FIRST OF ALL AND WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS COUNSEL'S REMARKS CONCERNING THE REPRESENTATIONS MADE ABOUT THE CHARACTERIZATION OF DETECTIVE FUHRMAN'S REMOVAL, QUOTE, UNQUOTE, REASSIGNMENT, BEING PULLED OFF THE CASE.THIS HAS BEEN NOW PRESENTED TO THIS COURT AS THOUGH SOME TERRIBLY PREJUDICIAL AND DAMAGING THING WAS DONE TO DETECTIVE FUHRMAN IN THAT THE CASE WAS REASSIGNED TO THE DETECTIVES FROM ROBBERY-HOMICIDE DIVISION.THIS COURT KNOWS, AS I KNOW THAT COUNSEL IS AWARE, THAT SUCH REASSIGNMENTS HAPPEN ON A DAILY, IN FACT ALMOST HOURLY BASIS; THAT THERE WILL BE INITIAL OFFICERS ON THE SCENE, THAT THE CASE WILL THEN BE ASSIGNED TO ONE DIVISION OR ANOTHER AND THAT WHEN THE CASE SEEMS TO BE COMPLEX OR OF A CERTAIN NATURE, ROBBERY-HOMICIDE OR MAJOR CRIMES TAKES OVER. IT IS A ROUTINE OCCURRENCE, NOTHING UNUSUAL IN IT.AND TO HYPOTHESIZE BASED ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN WOULD THEN FEEL SO OUTRAGED AT THE REASSIGNMENT, THAT HE WOULD BE MOVED TO COMMIT A FELONY IS NOTHING SHORT OF RIDICULOUS AND APPALLING, AND IT IS TYPICAL OF THE KIND OF FLIGHTS OF FANTASY ABOUT POSSIBLE MOTIVE THAT THE DEFENSE TAKES OFF ON, TYPICAL OF THE GROUNDLESS AND YET INFLAMMATORY RHETORIC THAT HAS BEEN PROFERRED BY THE DEFENSE AND WOULD BE PROFFERED BEFORE THIS JURY IF THEY ARE PERMITTED TO DO SO IN AN EFFORT TO DISTRACT THEM FROM THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE.AND THAT IS WHAT THE PEOPLE ARE SEEKING TO AVOID. IF WHAT WE WANT, YOUR HONOR, IS TO HAVE A JURY THAT WILL MAKE A RATIONAL AND INTELLIGENT DECISION BASED ON EVIDENCE AND NOT AN IRRATIONAL AND EMOTIONAL DECISION BASED ON IRRELEVANT AND REMOTE INFORMATION THAT IS UNRELIABLE, THEN WE MUST BE VERY, VERY CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT IS PERMISSIBLE MATERIAL FOR CROSS-EXAMINATION.AS THE COURT IS AWARE I'M SURE, PEOPLE VERSUS HALL APPLIES TO THE ANALYSIS REGARDLESS OF THE NATURE OF THE MOTIVE. THE ANALYSIS REMAINS THE SAME.WHETHER THE MOTIVE IS TO PLANT EVIDENCE BECAUSE THE DEFENDANT IS OF A PARTICULAR RACE OR BECAUSE HE IS ANGRY AT HAVING BEEN TAKEN OFF A CASE, THE MOTIVE IS THE SAME -- THE MOTIVE REGARDLESS OF WHAT IT IS, THE ANALYSIS REMAINS THE SAME, AND PEOPLE VERSUS HALL APPLIES.AND IT APPLIES VERY WELL IN THIS CASE FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS.NUMBER ONE, AS A GENERAL PROPOSITION, THE COURT I KNOW IS AWARE THAT MERE MOTIVE ALONE IS INSUFFICIENT TO CHARGE ANYONE WITH ANYTHING. IF ALL WE HAD WAS THE -- WAS THE WIFE OF A MAN MURDERED AND THE MAN HAD NO ALIBI, THAT'S ALL WE HAD, AND WE COULD PROVE THAT HE REASONABLY THREATENED HER OR THEY HAD AN ARGUMENT, WE HAVE MOTIVE, BUT WE HAVE NOTHING ELSE. HE COULD NOT BE CHARGED. WE COULD NOT BRING CHARGES. AND IF THAT WERE THE CASE, THERE WOULD BE NO CASE.BUT THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT THE DEFENSE INTENDS TO DO HERE. THEY PRESENT WHAT THEY DEEM TO BE EVIDENCE OF MOTIVE IN THIS CASE, WHICH WE DISPUTE AS WELL, BUT EVIDENCE OF MOTIVE NONETHELESS IN THEIR OPINION, AND WITHOUT ANY DEMONSTRATION OF OPPORTUNITY OR POSSIBILITY, PHYSICAL CAPABILITY IN THIS CASE, THEY SEEK TO HAVE THIS EVIDENCE ADMITTED BEFORE THE JURY, KNOWING FULL WELL THAT IT'S AN INFLAMMATORY -- THE INFLAMMATORY NATURE OF THE EVIDENCE WILL DISTRACT, WILL CONFUSE, WILL DISTORT THIS CASE AND PREVENT THE JURY FROM FOCUSING ON THE EVIDENCE.AND THAT IS THE INTENT. AND THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THAT THERE IS A PHYSICAL IMPOSSIBILITY THAT THEY ARE NOT ADDRESSING.NOT ONCE DURING THE DEFENSE PRESENTATION HAS THIS COURT SEEN THE DEFENSE PROFFER ANYTHING IN THE NATURE OF AN OFFER OF PROOF AS TO HOW THEY INTEND TO DEMONSTRATE THAT SUCH AN ACT AS THE ONE THAT THEY ARE ALLEGING COULD HAVE BEEN COMMITTED. NOT ONCE.THAT'S A VERY NOTABLE ABSENCE BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY NOW ALL AFTERNOON TO PRESENT TO YOUR HONOR WHAT EVIDENCE OR WHAT THEORY THEY WILL PRESENT -- THEY WILL PROCEED ON TO DEMONSTRATE THAT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO WHAT THEY ALLEGE. IN FACT, HE DID NOT.I AGREE WITH MR. COCHRAN VERY WHOLEHEARTEDLY. I AM VERY EAGER TO GET ON WITH THE EVIDENCE BECAUSE THE POSTURING AND THE REPRESENTATIONS CONTINUALLY MADE ABOUT WHAT CAN BE DONE AND WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED AND WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED ARE REALLY REACHING THE OUTER LIMITS OF FLIGHTS OF FANTASY.AND WHEN WE FINALLY DO PRESENT EVIDENCE, I'M SURE THAT MUCH OF THE POSTURING THAT THE COURT HAS SEEN FROM THE DEFENSE CONCERNING WHAT THEORIES THEY'D LIKE TO PURSUE ARE GOING TO FALL BY THE WAYSIDE BECAUSE REALITY WILL SIMPLY PREVENT IT.NOW, WITH RESPECT TO THEIR ALLEGATIONS CONCERNING THE 1985 INCIDENT, COUNSEL WOULD LIKE TO MAKE MUCH OF THE FACT THAT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN REMEMBERS SO VIVIDLY THE INCIDENT IN WHICH HE SAW THE DEFENDANT WITH A BASEBALL BAT AND NICOLE IN A MERCEDES, SEATED IN A CAR WHERE THE WINDSHIELD WAS COMPLETELY SHATTERED AND THE DEFENDANT ADMITTED THAT HE HAS DONE SO.NOW, THAT IS A SITUATION THAT ANY NORMAL PERSON WOULD FIND INDELIBLY IMPRESSED ON THEIR MEMORY. I THINK FOR MOST OF US -- I KNOW FOR MYSELF, YOUR HONOR, IF I WERE TO HAVE MET A CELEBRITY AND SIMPLY SHAKEN THEIR HAND OR GOTTEN THEIR AUTOGRAPH, WHICH IS AN ORDINARY THING, YOU KNOW, THAT MIGHT BE THE ORDINARY KIND OF INTERACTION THAT SOMEONE WOULD HAVE WITH A CELEBRITY, YOU WOULD REMEMBER IT FOREVER.BUT TO CONFRONT A CELEBRITY IN SUCH A SITUATION AFTER SUCH OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT HAS BEEN COMMITTED, I THINK THAT ANYONE WOULD REMEMBER THAT. THAT WOULD NEVER LEAVE THEIR MEMORY BECAUSE YOU DO NOT EXPECT SOMEONE OF SUCH RENOWN TO BEHAVE IN SUCH AN OUTRAGEOUS MANNER.AND TO SOMEHOW DRAW SOME NEGATIVE INFERENCE FROM THE FACT THAT AS A NORMAL HUMAN BEING, HE'S IMPRESSED AND REMEMBERS SOMETHING THAT IS SO MEMORABLE IS ABSURD. YOU WOULD EXPECT ANY PERSON TO REMEMBER SOMETHING THAT SHOCKING.AND OF COURSE, HE DID. BUT WHETHER HE DID OR NOT IS IRRELEVANT. HE WON'T TESTIFY TO THAT PARTICULAR INCIDENT. WE HAVE SOMEONE ELSE WHO APPEARED ON THE SCENE BEFORE HE DID AND WAS PERCIPIENT TO MANY MORE OBSERVATIONS THAN HE WAS.
","JANUARY 13, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
#THE COURT: ,"BUT ISN'T THE POINT THE FACT THAT HE WAS PREVIOUSLY ACQUAINTED WITH BOTH OF THE DEFENDANT AND THE VICTIM? ISN'T THAT THE POINT?
","JANUARY 13, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
#MS. CLARK: ,"I THINK THAT IS THE POINT THAT THEY ARE ATTEMPTING TO MAKE WITH THAT, YOUR HONOR. AND IN THAT CONNECTION, LET ME SAY THIS.

#THE COURT: ,"I AGREE WITH YOU; THAT IF I WERE TO HAVE MET MR. SIMPSON UNDER JUST ABOUT ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, I WOULD REMEMBER THAT. I MEAN I DON'T FIND THAT PART OF IT IMPLAUSIBLE. BUT IT IS THE FACT THAT THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY ACQUAINTED IS THE ISSUE.
","JANUARY 13, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
#MS. CLARK: ,"AND IT WAS A BRIEF ACQUAINTANCE THOUGH.AND I THINK THAT WHAT'S REALLY KIND OF INTERESTING ABOUT THAT IS THAT EVEN THOUGH HE DID APPEAR ON THE SCENE, HE WROTE NO REPORT, HE DID NOT ATTEMPT TO FORCE THE PROSECUTION OF THE MATTER, HE DID NOT INVOLVE HIMSELF IN ANY WAY THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT HE HAD A BIAS TOWARDS MR. SIMPSON.QUITE THE OPPOSITE. IT WAS ONLY AFTER THE CITY ATTORNEY SOLICITED HIS OPINION IN 1989 THAT HE SAID, ""WELL, I DO REMEMBER THIS."" AND THE FACT THAT IT WAS INDELIBLY IMPRESSED ON HIS MEMORY, OF COURSE BEING HUMAN.BUT IF THAT INCIDENT WERE SOMETHING THAT INDEED CAUSED HIM TO BE BIASED AGAINST MR. SIMPSON, THEN WE WOULD HAVE SEEN SOME CONDUCT AT THE TIME INDICATIVE OF THAT STATE OF MIND. BUT WE DIDN'T.AND THAT'S WHAT IS SO INTERESTING ABOUT THE DEFENSE ARGUMENT AT THIS TIME. WE HAVE STATEMENTS THAT WERE OF COURSE REPEATEDLY READ INTO THE RECORD BY COUNSEL IN THE ATTEMPT TO PUBLISH AND REPUBLISH INFLAMMATORY INFORMATION.BUT WHAT WE ARE NEGLECTING TO PAY ATTENTION TO IS THE FACT THAT YES, THERE IS A CONTEXT FOR THESE STATEMENTS, YES, THE MAN WAS UNDER STRESS, YES, HE WAS SPEAKING TO PSYCHIATRISTS, NOT THE OUTSIDE WORLD, HE WAS SPEAKING IN AN EFFORT TO GET DISABILITY, TO GET RELIEF FROM A STRESS-RELATED JOB.BUT THIS WAS 15 YEARS AGO OR NEARLY 15 YEARS AGO, YOUR HONOR. IT WAS A DISCRETE AND A REMOTE TIME PERIOD IN THAT DETECTIVE'S LIFE.IF THE ALLEGATION -- IF THE STATEMENTS -- THESE ARE SELF-REPORTED STATEMENTS BY THE WAY. THIS IS NOT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT HIM, YOUR HONOR. HE IS SELF-REPORTING THAT HE IS STRESSED OUT AND HE DOESN'T LIKE HIMSELF, HE DOESN'T LIKE WHERE HE'S AT. BUT THAT WAS 15 YEARS AGO.I THINK ALL OF US HAVE GONE THROUGH A LOT OF CHANGES IN OUR LIVES. WHERE OUR HEADS WERE 15 YEARS AGO MAY HAVE AND VERY LIKELY DOES HAVE NO BEARING ON WHERE THEY ARE TODAY.DETECTIVE FUHRMAN REPORTED 15 YEARS AGO TO A CERTAIN STATE OF MIND. SINCE THAT TIME, WE HAD NO REPORTS OR OBSERVATIONS BY THIRD PARTIES OF ANY CONDUCT BY DETECTIVE FUHRMAN CONSONANT WITH RACISM OR BIAS.IN FACT, WHAT'S NOTABLE ABOUT KATHLEEN BELL'S STATEMENT IS THAT SHE CAME FORWARD TO NO ONE AND SAID NOTHING ABOUT THIS UNTIL THE CASE HAPPENED, AT WHICH POINT SHE SAW AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE FAMOUS, AS SO MANY HAVE FROM BOTH SIDES OF THIS CASE.IT IS A DEFINITE -- IT'S A PROBLEM WITH THIS CASE THAT BOTH SIDES HAVE TO BE WARY OF, ALL SIDES HAVE TO BE WARY OF. THERE'S SO MUCH FAME AND NOTORIETY ATTACHED TO IT THAT PEOPLE WILL INJECT THEMSELVES WHERE PROBABLY THEY SHOULD NOT. AND I THINK KATHLEEN BELL MAY WELL BE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE.NEVERTHELESS, IT'S INTERESTING TO NOTE SHE MADE NO COMPLAINTS AND SAID NOTHING ABOUT THESE ALLEGED REMARKS BY DETECTIVE FUHRMAN UNTIL AFTER THIS CASE CAME OUT, AND SHE DID NOT MAKE -- I THINK IT'S ALSO VERY INTERESTING HOW CONVENIENTLY SHE MAKES THOSE REMARKS FIT IN WITH THE FACTS OF THIS CASE, AN INTERRACIAL COUPLE AND WHATNOT.BUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT. IF KATHLEEN BELL IS ULTIMATELY CALLED TO THE WITNESS STAND FOR ANY REASON, WE CAN TAKE UP HER CREDIBILITY AT THAT TIME, AND THEN THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW WHAT I THINK HER CREDIBILITY REALLY IS.NEVERTHELESS, WHAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE HERE IS A VERY DISCREET WOMAN IN TIME THAT IS REMOTE AND WE HAVE NOTHING IN-BETWEEN THAT SHOULD INDICATE -- THAT SHOULD BE THERE TO CORROBORATE WHAT THE DEFENSE IS ALLEGING MR. -- DETECTIVE FUHRMAN'S STATE OF MIND IS. AND BY THAT, I MEAN THIRD-PARTY OBSERVATIONS OF MORE RECENT NATURE.THIS IS A POLICE OFFICER WHO'S OUT IN THE STREET AND OUT IN THE PUBLIC EVERY DAY. IN THAT CASE, YOU WOULD EXPECT PEOPLE TO BE COMING FORWARD TO SAY, ""HE'S BEEN DOING THIS, HE'S BEEN SAYING THAT, I'VE SEEN HIM DO THIS AND I'VE HEARD HIM SAY THAT."" BUT WE HAVE NONE OF IT.AND MR. COCHRAN OBLIQUELY REFERRED TO SOME INFORMATION HE'S GOT, AND WITH THE DISCOVERY ORDERS THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED FROM THIS COURT, THE FACT THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED NOTHING IS VERY ALARMING TO ME. IF MR. COCHRAN IS IN POSSESSION OF SUCH INFORMATION, IT'S LONG OVERDUE TO BE TURNED OVER TO THE PROSECUTION. I SUSPECT THAT HE DOES NOT.AND IN THAT CASE, WHAT THE COURT SHOULD ASK ITSELF, WHAT IS THE PROBATIVE VALUE OF THESE SELF-REPORT STATEMENTS MADE IN A WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIM 15 YEARS AGO WITHOUT ANY INDEPENDENT CORROBORATION OR ANY MORE RECENT EVENT TO SOMEHOW CONNECT IT UP TO THE PRESENT TIME?THAT'S WHAT WOULD MAKE IT PROBATIVE IF ANYTHING COULD. BUT INSTEAD, WE DON'T HAVE THAT.AS THE COURT IS WELL AWARE, ANY DEFENDANT WHO TAKES THE WITNESS STAND WHO HAS A PRIOR CONVICTION THAT IS REMOTE, 15 YEARS AGO WITH NO INTERVENING CRIMINAL CONDUCT UPDATING THAT 15-YEAR OLD CONVICTION, COULD NOT BE IMPEACHED WITH IT BECAUSE THE COURT WOULD RIGHTFULLY FIND IT WOULD BE UNDULY PREJUDICIAL TO IMPEACH THE DEFENDANT WITH WHAT MAY HAVE SIMPLY BEEN ABERRANT PERIOD IN HIS LIFE.IF IN EFFECT, WE ARE PERMITTING THE CROSS-EXAMINATION OF DETECTIVE FUHRMAN WITH THIS INFORMATION, WE ARE AFFORDING OUR WITNESSES FEWER RIGHTS THAN WE ARE OF THE DEFENDANTS, AND THAT SEEMS COMPLETELY UNFAIR.MOREOVER, WHAT WE HAVE IN ADDITION -- WELL, I AM SORRY. LET ME INTERRUPT MY -- I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE DEFENSE ARGUMENTS CONCERNING THE COMPARISON TO 1101(B).THERE IS SIMPLY NO COMPARISON TO THE 1101(B) MOTION. FIRST OF ALL, LET ME INDICATE THIS.MR. COCHRAN HAS REPEATEDLY STATED THAT 17 OR 18 INCIDENTS WERE THROWN OUT BY THE PROSECUTION OR PRESENTED TO THIS COURT AND THEN WITHDRAWN. THAT'S NOT THE CASE.THE DEFENSE MADE A MOTION IN ADVANCE OF OUR LISTING OF ANY OF THE EVENTS THAT WE INTENDED TO REQUEST FOR ADMISSION AND SOUGHT TO LIMIT THE EVIDENCE THAT WE WOULD ADMIT CONCERNING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. IN RESPONSE TO THEIR MOTION, WE SAID WE HAVE THE FOLLOWING LIST OF ITEMS.WE GAVE FULL AND FAIR DISCLOSURE TO THE DEFENSE OF EVERY POSSIBLE EVENT THAT MAY OCCUR, EVERY POSSIBLE PIECE OF EVIDENCE THAT MAY BE USED, WHETHER IT IS FOR THE PEOPLE'S CASE IN CHIEF, FOR CROSS-EXAMINATION OF THE DEFENSE WITNESSES OR ON REBUTTAL TO THE DEFENSE CASE OR FOR THE FOUNDATION FOR EXPERT TESTIMONY.THERE ARE MANY USES TO WHICH THIS EVIDENCE CAN BE PUT. BUT THE COURT WANTED US TO CONFINE -- THE COURT WANTED US TO EDIT THE LIST, TO PRESENT IT WITH SIMPLY WHAT WE WOULD BE ASKING TO PRESENT IN OUR CASE IN CHIEF, WHICH IS WHAT WE DID.BUT TO INFER FROM THAT SOMEHOW THAT WE WERE PRESENTING EVIDENCE TO THIS COURT THAT WE NEVER INTENDED TO PRESENT ULTIMATELY IS FALSE, IS MISLEADING. ALL OF THAT EVIDENCE MAY VERY WELL COME OUT. IN FACT, I'M SURE MUCH OF IT WILL AT ONE POINT OR ANOTHER THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL.AND HAD WE NOT GIVEN THE DEFENSE NOTICE OF ALL OF THE ITEMS THAT WE WERE SEEKING TO ADMIT FOR WHATEVER PURPOSE, WE WOULD BE HELD REMISS AND MR. UELMEN WOULD ONCE AGAIN CASTIGATE US FOR MISCONDUCT. AND I DON'T EVEN WANT TO GIVE HIM MORE CAUSE FOR THAT. SO WE GAVE THEM FULL AND COMPLETE NOTICE IN ORDER TO AVOID THAT VERY THING; THAT HE CANNOT COMPLAIN THAT THEY HAVE BEEN SURPRISED.NOW, WITH RESPECT TO 1101(B) AS COMPARED TO THE 15-YEAR OLD CONDUCT OR STATEMENTS BY DETECTIVE FUHRMAN, LET ME SAY THIS.

IT'S A PATTERN OF CONDUCT DATING BACK TO 17 YEARS AGO.WITH DETECTIVE FUHRMAN, WE HAVE THE EXACT OPPOSITE SITUATION. WE HAVE ONE SET OF STATEMENTS MADE BY HIM IN A CONFINED SITUATION 15 YEARS AGO WITH NOTHING AFTER THAT. AND SO IT CANNOT BE COMPARED JUST ON THAT BASIS ALONE. BUT I WON'T BELABOR THE POINT. THEN I WILL MOVE ON.COUNSEL MADE SEVERAL MISREPRESENTATIONS CONCERNING THE ROLE OF DETECTIVE FUHRMAN IN THIS MATTER. COUNSEL ATTEMPTS TO MAGNIFY HIS ROLE IN THIS CASE IN ORDER TO GIVE MORE LATITUDE TO THE ARGUMENT THAT HE THEREFORE MUST NECESSARILY BE IMPEACHED AND THAT IMPEACHMENT OF HIM IS COLLATERAL.
","JANUARY 13, 1995 ",9:17 A.M.
#THE COURT: ,"LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION AT THIS POINT, THOUGH.IN RAISING THE ISSUE OF WHAT THE SCOPE OF DETECTIVE FUHRMAN'S TESTIMONY IS GOING TO BE, THE ISSUE THAT COMES UP IN MY MIND IMMEDIATELY IS, HOW BROAD IS THAT SCOPE GOING TO BE, AND THE ARGUMENT BY THE DEFENSE THAT PERHAPS THIS MOTION IS PREMATURE WOULD PERHAPS BE WELL TAKEN BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT EXACTLY WHAT IT IS DETECTIVE FUHRMAN IS GOING TO TESTIFY TO, AND THE SCOPE OF CROSS-EXAMINATION WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE SCOPE OF WHAT IT IS THAT YOU PRESENT.I MEAN THAT'S PRETTY STANDARD. SO IF YOU PUT HIM ON FOR A WHOLE LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS, WE MAY GET INTO A WHOLE LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS ON CROSS-EXAMINATION. BUT I DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT.

#MS. CLARK: ,"RIGHT.AND I THINK THAT WAS A VERY WELL TAKEN POINT BY THE DEFENSE AS WELL, YOUR HONOR.THAT IS SOMETHING WE WILL NOT -- WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THERE WILL BE A GREAT DEAL OF TESTIMONY FROM DETECTIVE FUHRMAN BECAUSE IN TRUTH, HIS ROLE WAS SMALL. BY THE TIME HE PROCEEDED TO ROCKINGHAM, IT WAS THE CASE OF ROBBERY-HOMICIDE DIVISION.HE MADE SOME OBSERVATIONS AND SPOKE TO KATO KAELIN, AND THAT'S ABOUT THE EXTENT OF IT. HE DID NO FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION. HE CONDUCTED NO INTERVIEWS OF ANY OTHER WITNESSES BESIDES KATO KAELIN. AND WE KNOW THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF WITNESSES IN THIS CASE.THE FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN VOLUMINOUS. LAPD HAS BEEN INUNDATED WITH THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF PAGES OF DISCOVERY, NONE OF WHICH WAS GENERATED BY DETECTIVE FUHRMAN. DETECTIVE FUHRMAN HAS THE ONE LIMITED ROLE OF TAKING THE OFFICERS FROM BUNDY TO ROCKINGHAM, MAKING SOME OBSERVATIONS FOR THE LIMITED TIME HE WAS THERE, AND THEN IT WAS OVER.

COCHRAN HAS MISREPRESENTED THE EVIDENCE TO THE COURT EVEN TODAY.MR.

BUT IN FACT, THE ACCUSATION HAS NO BASIS IN PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OR IN PHYSICAL REALITY. AND THAT IS WHY ASKING THE COURT TO RULE IN FAVOR OF THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THIS EVIDENCE IN A BLIND IS UNFAIR AND UNREASONABLE.WHAT THE COURT NEEDS TO DO IS TO REQUIRE COUNSEL TO ESTABLISH A PRIMA FACIE CASE AT WHICH POINT, IF THEY HAVE DONE SO, WE WILL ALL BE IN A VERY DIFFERENT POSTURE TO RETHINK THE APPLICABILITY OR ADMISSIBILITY OF THAT TESTIMONY.BUT AT THIS TIME, COUNSEL HAS BEEN EVEN UNWILLING TO MAKE AN OFFER OF PROOF TO SHOW THE COURT HOW IT INTENDS TO ESTABLISH A PRIMA FACIE CASE LET ALONE PRESENT ANY EVIDENCE. WE CANNOT PROCEED TO ENGAGE IN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT IS ADMISSIBLE AND NOT WHEN THE PREDICATE OR THE GOAL OF THE CROSS-EXAMINATION THAT IS STATED BY COUNSEL IS INCAPABLE OF PROOF.IF COUNSEL AVERS THAT IT IS CAPABLE OF PROOF AND HAS A WAY OF PROVING IT AND DOES SO, THEN THAT'S DIFFERENT.

AGAIN I REALIZE THAT THIS IS A MURDER CASE AND THERE IS PROBATIVE VALUE TO EXPLAINING THE LOCATION OF THE BODIES. THERE ARE OTHER DIAGRAMS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO OFFER WHERE THERE WILL BE A SKETCH SHOWING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO BODIES, WHERE THEY ARE OUTLINED, TO WHICH I DO NOT OBJECT.BUT I DO NOT THINK THERE IS THE NEED FOR FOUR DIFFERENT PHOTOGRAPHS TO BE USED AT THIS POINT. I THINK IT CUMULATIVE. I THINK IT MORE THAN PROBATIVE. I WAS WILLING, FOR EXAMPLE, TO ACCEPT THE FIRST PICTURE FOR THE OVERVIEW AND THE THIRD PICTURE OF MISS SIMPSON.I WAS WILLING, FOR EXAMPLE, TO ACCEPT TWO OF THE FOUR PICTURES OF MR. GOLDMAN, BUT I DO NOT THINK, IN FAIRNESS TO THE DEFENDANT, THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE THE CUMULATIVE NATURE OF ALL OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS. THEY ARE ON GRAPHICS. THEY CAN EASILY BE SCANNED OR VOIDED.

WE ARE HERE, IT IS NOW JANUARY 23RD, AND ONLY TODAY DID WE RECEIVE DISCOVERY OF THESE STATEMENTS.THE DEFENSE HAS BEEN YELLING AND SCREAMING AT US FOR NOT TURNING OVER DISCOVERY WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF HAVING RECEIVED IT AND THEY NOW HAVE HAD THINGS FOR SIX AND SEVEN MONTHS AND ARE JUST TURNING IT OVER.THERE IS A VIDEOTAPE THAT THEY HAVE HAD TO HAVE HAD IN THEIR POSSESSION SINCE JUNE 13 THAT I WAS JUST SHOWN ON THE MONITOR TODAY.THE COURT HAS ORDERED THE DEFENSE TO TURN OVER DISCOVERY IN A TIMELY FASHION, JUST AS IT HAS ORDERED THE PEOPLE TO COMPLY WITH THE SAME ORDER. WE HAVE MADE NUMEROUS REQUESTS OF THE DEFENSE ON AND OFF THE RECORD TO PLEASE TURN OVER DISCOVERY AND TURN OVER STATEMENTS.THEY SAID THEY HAD NOTHING. THOSE WERE LIES AND THESE STATEMENTS PROVE THAT THEY WERE LIES BECAUSE THESE STATEMENTS WERE TAKEN IN JUNE AND JULY.AND YET AS RECENTLY AS JANUARY THEY WERE SAYING THAT THEY HAD NO FURTHER DISCOVERY TO GIVE US AND THAT THEY WERE IN FULL COMPLIANCE.

#MR. COCHRAN: ,"YOUR HONOR, WHAT I WOULD INDICATE ON THAT IS THIS.FIRST OF ALL, THE COURT CAN SEE THERE'S A LOT OF MATERIAL ON THE TAPE THAT WE HAVE HERE WHICH WOULD BE BASICALLY IRRELEVANT AND IMMATERIAL. SO WHAT HAPPENED IS, WE TOOK THE PARTS THAT WE THOUGHT WERE APPROPRIATE. IT'S AN ACCURATE AND TRUE COPY AS YOU CAN SEE.WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS GIVE THE COURT THE ACCURATE AND TRUE COPIES TAKEN BY NEWS ORGANIZATIONS OF WHAT HAPPENED CONTEMPORANEOUSLY WITH THE EVENT.AND SO I THINK CLEARLY, WHAT I'VE ALWAYS ARGUED, THIS IS ADMISSIBLE FROM THE STANDPOINT SHOWING WHAT HAPPENED IF WE WANTED TO ARGUE THAT CERTAIN THINGS WERE SHOWN IN THESE PHOTOGRAPHS WITH REGARD TO THE COLLECTION OF EVIDENCE BY LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT REPRESENTATIVES AND THE CORONER'S OFFICE.SO WHAT I'VE ARGUED FROM THIS MORNING IS THAT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT BECOMES A QUESTION NOT OF ADMISSIBILITY, BUT OF WEIGHT. AND IT SEEMS THAT MISS CLARK HAD AN OBJECTION THIS MORNING THAT WE COULDN'T DETERMINE WHEN THESE THINGS WERE DONE, WHEN THEY WERE TAKEN.WELL, YOU WILL NOTICE ON THE TAPE THAT WAS SHOWN THIS AFTERNOON THE INDIVIDUALS BEING LOGGED IN AS THEY CAME IN. WE CAN LOOK AT THE LOG AND DETERMINE THE TIME. WE KNOW WHAT TIME THE CORONERS GOT THERE. SO WE KNOW WHAT TIME THE BODIES WERE TAKEN AWAY AND THAT SORT OF THING.I THINK WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DEMONSTRATE ON THESE TAPES WAS THE COLLECTION PROCEDURES, AS THE COURT RIGHTLY SAID THIS MORNING. IT WOULD BE NICE IF THAT ALL WAS ON ONE GROUP OF TAKES. APPARENTLY THAT'S NOT SO.AND WE WOULD LIKE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW YOU THE OTHER TAPE. THESE ARE NOT ANYTHING THAT WE IN ANY WAY HAVE CHANGED AROUND OR WHATEVER. WE'RE JUST TRYING TO DEMONSTRATE AT THAT SCENE ON JUNE 13TH WHILE DETECTIVES VANNATTER AND LANGE AND DETECTIVE ROGERS WAS AT THAT SCENE, THESE THINGS TOOK PLACE. SO THAT I THINK THAT FROM LAYING A FOUNDATION, CLEARLY WE CAN PINPOINT AND AFFIX THE TIME IT SEEMS.
","JANUARY 23, 1995 ",9:21 A.M.
#THE COURT: ,"BUT THE PROBLEM WITH THIS VIDEOTAPE IS, OBVIOUSLY STARTS AND STOPS. IT TAKES THE -- I RECALL AT LEAST THREE DIFFERENT VANTAGE POINTS. SO OBVIOUSLY THE TAPE HAD TO STOP.

I THINK WE ALL AGREE WITH THAT.IT WAS YOUR OBLIGATION TO PUT TOGETHER THIS ITEM AND SHOW IT TO THE PROSECUTION IN A TIMELY MANNER, WHICH HAS NOT OCCURRED. SO MY INCLINATION AT THIS POINT IS, SINCE THE PROSECUTION RAISES THE OBJECTION, MY INCLINATION IS TO RULE THAT YOU CAN NOT USE THIS VIDEOTAPE MONTAGE IN THE COURSE OF YOUR OPENING STATEMENTS AND YOU MAY NOT USE IT UNTIL YOU'VE SHOWN THESE VIDEOTAPES TO THE PEOPLE.I ALSO AM NOT GOING TO GRANT THEIR MOTION TO CONTINUE.

BUT AS THE COURT KNOWS, A DEFENDANT IN A CRIMINAL CASE DOESN'T HAVE TO PROVE ANYTHING AND YOU'VE SAID THAT TO THE JURORS AND THAT'S WHAT THE LAWS ARE.IN THIS CASE, WE WANT TO ANTICIPATE MANY THINGS THAT THE PROSECUTION IS GOING TO DO AND ARGUE AND THAT SORT OF THING. SO OUR JOB FROM THE VERY BEGINNING IN DEFENDING THIS MAN IS TO GATHER AS MUCH EVIDENCE AS WE CAN.YOUR HONOR, THERE'S NO OBLIGATION IT SEEMS TO ME IF WE GOT THAT TAPE OR IT CAME IN OUR POSSESSION LET'S SAY IN AUGUST TO SHARE IT AT THAT TIME WITH THE PROSECUTION. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ISSUES ARE GOING TO BE.AT SUCH TIME AS WE NOW KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING, WHAT THEIR THEORY IS -- THEY SAID TO YOU IN THIS COURT LAST WEEK, ""FOR THE FIFTH TIME, WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE OUR STRATEGY OR CHANGE OUR THEORY."" THE COURT WILL RECALL THAT BYPLAY WITH MR. DARDEN.NOW, LET'S ASSUME NOW THEY FINALLY SETTLE ON SOMETHING THEY WANT TO GO FORWARD WITH. NOW, THAT MEANS NOW WE NOW HAVE TO SAY, ""OKAY, GUYS, LET'S GET GEARED UP. LET'S GO BACK AND DO IT.""WITH THAT THOUGHT IN MIND, WE THEN TRY TO PUT THIS TOGETHER.
","JANUARY 23, 1995 ",9:21 A.M.
#THE COURT: ,"MR. COCHRAN, THAT PART OF YOUR DEFENSE AND THAT PART OF THEIR CASE HAS NEVER CHANGED. THEY HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO PRESENT FORENSIC EVIDENCE REGARDING WHAT WAS COLLECTED AT THE CRIME SCENE AND YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO ATTACK THE PROCESS AND THE INTEGRITY AND THE RELIABILITY OF THAT EVIDENCE. THAT HASN'T CHANGED.
","JANUARY 23, 1995 ",9:21 A.M.
#MR. COCHRAN: ,"THAT HAS NOT CHANGED, YOUR HONOR. HOWEVER, HOW WE ATTACK AND WHAT WE DO WITH IT, YOU KNOW, MAY CHANGE.AS YOU CAN APPRECIATE, THERE WAS A LOT OF SOUL SEARCHING WITH REGARD TO THE DNA HEARING AND HOW WE LOOK AT THAT AND THAT SORT OF THING. THIS EVIDENCE HELPED US THROUGH THAT ABSOLUTE -- THROUGH THAT PARTICULAR PART OF IT.BUT AT SOME POINT, WE HAVE TO MAKE A POSITION THAT OKAY, NOW, HERE'S HOW WE WANT TO GO FORWARD. AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THE COURT UNDERSTANDS OUR THINKING FROM THAT STANDPOINT.JUDGE, THIS IS NOT ANY BIG SURPRISE. THIS IS THEIR CRIME SCENE, JUDGE. THE WITNESSES DEPICTED IN THE CRIME SCENE ARE THESE GENTLEMEN SEATED HERE. THIS IS THEIR CASE. AND SO WE JUST HAVE PICTURES OF WHAT THEY WERE DOING.SO I DON'T SEE THAT THERE'S SURPRISE OR THEY'RE IN ANY WAY PREJUDICED. AS ALWAYS, YOU KNOW, WE WANT TO SHARE WITH THEM WHAT WE HAVE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME.AND I THINK -- REASONABLE MINDS CAN DIFFER AT WHAT POINT THE DEFENSE HAS TO REVEAL THESE THINGS, BECAUSE THIS ISN'T LIKE ANY BIG SURPRISE TO THE PROSECUTION. THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE OUT THERE DOING THESE THINGS.

THAT'S THE QUESTION THAT I HAVE.

#MR. BAILEY: ,"LET ME START AT A FUNDAMENTAL POINT.
","JANUARY 23, 1995 ",9:21 A.M.
#THE COURT: ,"IN OTHER WORDS, HOW DO I MAKE THAT BRIDGE FROM THIS TO WHAT YOU ARE ATTEMPTING TO PROVE REGARDING DETECTIVE FUHRMAN?
","JANUARY 23, 1995 ",9:21 A.M.
#MR. BAILEY: ,"AGAINST THE FRUSTRATIONS OF OUR EARLY EXCURSIONS, YOUR HONOR, THIS TASK IS LIFTED FROM YOUR SHOULDERS BY THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT IN THE SECOND DISTRICT WHERE IT CLEARLY RULED THAT TO ELIMINATE ANY QUESTIONS ON CROSS-EXAMINATION OF A RELEVANT WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION RELATING TO HIS RACIAL BIAS AGAINST A PERSON OR A RACE OF WHICH HE IS A MEMBER WOULD BE FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL ERROR PER SE WITH NO DISCRETION.SO IF YOU START FROM THAT POINT AND THEN ASSUME, AS I THINK YOU SHOULD BASED ON THE FACTS OF THIS CASE, THAT WITHOUT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN, THERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY TO GET INTO EVIDENCE THAT GLOVE CLAIMED TO MATCH THE ONE FOUND AT THE SCENE, CLAIMED TO HAVE THE BLOOD OF THE MURDER VICTIMS ON IT WHICH ALLEGEDLY WAS LOCATED BY FUHRMAN IN AN ALLEY BETWEEN A CHAIN LINK FENCE AND THE DEFENDANT'S HOUSE ON HIS PREMISES ON THE MORNING OF THE 13TH, YOU ANTICIPATE THAT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN WILL BE A WITNESS. WE ARE ENTITLED TO ATTACK THE CREDIBILITY OF ANY WITNESS WHOSE TESTIMONY TENDS TO INCRIMINATE THE ACCUSED.IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE HAVE TOLD YOU IN OUR PAPERS AND PERHAPS THE FIRST TIME THAT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN THEN WENT ON WITHIN HOURS TO SUPPRESS VITAL EVIDENCE TENDING TO EXCULPATE THE DEFENDANT BECAUSE HE INTERVIEWED AND ASKED QUESTIONS OF ONE ROSA LOPEZ, WHO LIVES NEXT DOOR, WHO SAW THE DEFENDANT'S BRONCO AT ITS PARKING SPOT ON ROCKINGHAM BETWEEN 10:15 AND 10:20 THAT NIGHT, HE REPORTED IT TO NO ONE, THERE ARE NO REPORTS ABOUT IT, AND SHE HAS NEVER BEEN INTERVIEWED BY THE PROSECUTION AS OF LAST NIGHT.SO IF HE SUPPRESSED EVIDENCE AND CLAIMED TO FIND INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE, I THINK WE HARDLY NEED GO FURTHER BEFORE WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASK HIM, ""AND BY THE WAY, HAVEN'T YOU SAID ON PAST OCCASIONS THAT YOU ARE IN FAVOR OF GENOCIDE?""BECAUSE WHAT HE REALLY SAID WAS, ""LET'S PUT THEM ALL IN A PILE AND BURN THEM ALL."" AND I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT COME FROM ANYONE SINCE ADOLF HITLER. THAT'S A PRETTY EXTREME STATEMENT.NOT ONLY THAT; MR. FUHRMAN AS OF THIS MORNING INVOKED THE JURISDICTION OF GOOD MORNING AMERICA TO MAKE PUBLIC AND TRUCULENT STATEMENT ABOUT THE TRIAL PLANS AND AMMUNITION OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE PROSECUTION AS TO HOW THEY WILL DECIMATE THE WITNESS WHO CLAIMS SHE HEARD HIM SAY THESE THINGS AFTER SHE TRIED TO FIX HIM UP WITH A WOMAN WHO HAD GONE OUT WITH A BLACK MAN. THIS WAS AN OUTBURST.SO I CANNOT IMAGINE A CLEARER CASE OF THE DEFENSE HAVING AN ABSOLUTE AND INALIENABLE, INDELIBLE, IRREVOCABLE RIGHT TO SMASH INTO ANY PERSON SO LOW LIFE AS TO MAKE THOSE UTTERANCES AND THEN TO PROCEED TO THE WITNESS STAND AND ATTEMPT TO INCRIMINATE FOR MURDER THROUGH THESE DEFALCATIONS AND SPORULATION A MEMBER OF THE AFRICAN AMERICAN RACE.THERE COULD BE NO CLEARER CASE. BUT THE ANTHONY CASE, YOUR HONOR, IT SEEMS TO ME MAKES IT VERY CLEAR TO THE COURT THAT ANY ELIMINATION OR LIMITATION -- BECAUSE IN ANTHONY, ONE RACIAL BIAS QUESTION WAS ALLOWED, THE SECOND ONE WAS EXCLUDED.AND THAT WAS HELD TO BE A VIOLATION NOT OF CALIFORNIA, BUT OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION, RELYING ON DAVIS V. ALASKA, A 1974 CASE IN WHICH CHIEF JUSTICE BERGER JOINED BY SIX OTHER JUSTICES CONDEMNED ANY LIMITATION ON RACIAL BIAS QUESTIONS ON CROSS-EXAMINATION.I DON'T SEE ANY WIGGLING ROOM. AND WHILE I WAS HAPPY TO PUT TOGETHER THE PROFFER THAT YOU ASKED FOR IN YOUR RULING, YOUR HONOR, SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU ASKED FOR IT, I DON'T THINK IT WAS NECESSARY.I THINK ONCE FUHRMAN HITS THE STAND WITHOUT ANY WARNING TO ANYBODY AS TO WHAT WE'RE UP TO, WE'RE ABLE TO ASK HIM, ""DON'T YOU HATE BLACK PEOPLE AND HAVEN'T YOU SAID SO ON MANY OCCASIONS AND PARTICULARLY THIS OCCASION AFTER YOU LEARNED THAT THIS DEFENDANT HAD A ROMANTIC ENTANGLEMENT WITH A CAUCASIAN WOMAN?""I BELIEVE THAT CROSSES THE BRIDGE AND I BELIEVE IT CROSSES IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT CAN NEVER BE TORN DOWN.I THINK BEYOND THE ANTHONY CASE, THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE TO LOOK. CERTAINLY THIS IS AN AREA CARVED OUT WHERE JUDICIAL DISCRETION HAS BEEN PINCHED DOWN TO THE POINT WHERE IT MAY NOT EXIST, EXCEPT IN CASES OF RANK ABUSE WHEN THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE RELEVANCE TO THE PERSON'S BIAS AS IT RELATED TO HIS TESTIMONY.BUT THE BIAS OF THIS WITNESS AGAINST THIS DEFENDANT IN PARTICULAR AND HIS RACE IN GENERAL COULD WELL EXPLAIN A NUMBER OF FALSE STATEMENTS ON HIS PART, WHICH WE'RE GOING TO TELL THE JURY HE'S MADE. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO PROVE THAT HE PLANTED ANYTHING BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE TO.WE'RE SIMPLY SAYING, IF THE ONLY EVIDENCE YOU HAVE THAT THIS GLOVE CAME FROM O.J. SIMPSON'S HOME IS DETECTIVE MARK FUHRMAN, THAT ISN'T ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO CONVICT A RAT, LET ALONE A HUMAN BEING. AND I THINK THAT'S A FAIR ARGUMENT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS CASE.AFTER ALL, THERE'S ANOTHER PRINCIPAL AT PLAY HERE, IF IT PLEASE THE COURT.THIS IS THE PEOPLE'S WITNESS. THE PEOPLE ARE ESTOPPED TO COMPLAIN THAT HAVING BEEN PUT ON NOTICE IN 1981 THAT THIS FELLOW HAD TERRIBLE RACIST FEELINGS, TERRIBLE FEELINGS, HE COULDN'T CONTROL HIS VIOLENCE AGAINST PEOPLE HE WAS ARRESTING, THEY FOUND THAT HE NOT ONLY WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO STAY ON AS AN LAPD DETECTIVE, BUT PROMOTED HIM IN THE PROCESS.AND CERTAINLY, IF MRS. BELL WAS HEARING HIS RACIST FEELINGS IN 1985 AND 1986, SOMEONE IN THE DEPARTMENT WAS HEARING IT AND THEY WERE TERRIBLY INSENSITIVE TO LEAVE HIM WITH A BADGE AND A GUN KNOWING HOW HE FELT IN THIS CITY AND THE TURMOIL IT SUFFERED.DOES THE COURT HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AS TO THE PROFFER?

#MS. LEWIS: ,"GOOD AFTERNOON, YOUR HONOR.I WAS IMPRESSED BY MR. BAILEY'S DRAMA AND EMPHASIS AND FINGER POINTING, BUT THAT DOES NOT TAKE THE PLACE OF AN OFFER OF PROOF OF EVIDENCE, WHICH IS WHAT THIS COURT RULED WAS REQUIRED. MR. BAILEY ALSO JUST NOW APPARENTLY WAS SEEKING TO RELITIGATE THE MOTION ITSELF, AND THAT WAS TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE.THE OFFER OF PROOF THAT THE DEFENSE GIVES THE COURT WITHIN THEIR MOTION IS PROOF OF SPECULATION. THERE IS SIMPLY NOTHING IN HERE.FURTHER, THEY GO BEYOND AND THEY NOW ARE CLAIMING THAT THE BRONCO WAS MOVED; BECAUSE OF INCONSISTENT TESTIMONY EARLY ON AT THE PRELIMINARY HEARING, THAT THE DEFENDANT'S FORD BRONCO IS MOVED.THIS IS A BRAND NEW ALLEGATION ARISING OUT OF HOLE CLOTH, OUT OF DEFENSE SPECULATION, OUT OF THE DREAM OF THE DEFENSE TEAM THAT SOMETHING COULD COME UP TO DIVERT THE JURY'S ATTENTION IN A VERY SERIOUS WAY.THE COURT SAW THE DEMONSTRATION -- I SHOULDN'T SAY DEMONSTRATION -- BUT THE EFFECT OF THE RACIAL ARGUMENT, AS IT HAPPENS, WHEN IT CAME OUT THROUGH MR. DARDEN FOR THE PROSECUTION AND MR. COCHRAN FOR THE DEFENSE. THE COURT SAW FOR ITSELF HOW VERY INFLAMMATORY THAT GETS VERY EASILY.THE COURT RULED ON THESE AREAS, RULED UNDER 352 THAT THE 1981 LAWSUIT WAS TOO REMOTE TO BE REASONABLY RELEVANT HERE, THAT THE JOSEPH BRITTON MATTER WAS TOO REMOTE TO BE REASONABLY RELEVANT HERE.THE COURT --
","JANUARY 23, 1995 ",9:21 A.M.

#MS. LEWIS: ,"THANK YOU.AND I OVERSTATED IT WHEN I SAID THAT IT WAS TOO REMOTE TO BE RELEVANT SINCE IT WAS PURELY SPECULATION, AND THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE TO BACK THAT EITHER.BUT IN THIS SITUATION, THE COURT'S RULING WAS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR TO ME, HAVING READ IT. IT WAS DETAILED IN FIVE PAGES. AND WHAT WAS CLEAR IS THAT THE DEFENSE -- FOUR AND A HALF.WHAT WAS CLEAR WAS THAT THE COURT WAS REQUIRING OF THE DEFENSE SOME OFFER OF EVIDENCE THAT THIS DETECTIVE MOVED EVIDENCE, WHETHER IT BE THE GLOVE OR ANY OTHER EVIDENCE.
","JANUARY 23, 1995 ",9:21 A.M.
#THE COURT: ,"BUT THE ARGUMENT HAS CHANGED AND SHIFTED. THE ARGUMENT HAS NOW -- IS NOW GONE --SEE, THE INTERESTING THING IS, THE WAY THIS ALL PLAYED OUT BECAUSE IT STARTED OUT AS A MOTION IN LIMINE BY THE PROSECUTION TO LIMIT THIS. SO ESSENTIALLY, YOU FRAMED THE ISSUE AS YOU WANTED IT, WHICH WAS THE ALLEGATION PUBLISHED IN A MAGAZINE BACK EAST THAT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN HAD PLANTED THE EVIDENCE.SO THAT WAS THE POINT OF YOUR OFFENSIVE IN THIS CASE. THE RESPONSE THAT I GOT THIS MORNING FROM THE DEFENSE IS THAT THEY ARE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE ENTITLED TO CROSS-EXAMINE AS TO RACIAL ANIMUS. AND THEY CITE TWO CASES THAT APPEAR TO BE CONTROLLING.
","JANUARY 23, 1995 ",9:21 A.M.
#MS. LEWIS: ,"I'M NOT AWARE OF THE SECOND CASE. BUT OF COURSE, THEY CITED THE ANTHONY P. CASE, WHICH I, AS AN OFFICER OF THE COURT, BROUGHT TO THE COURT'S ATTENTION BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T EVEN ABLE TO LOCATE THAT DURING THEIR EARLIER RESPONSE.THE ANTHONY P. CASE, YOUR HONOR, I BELIEVE IS DISTINGUISHABLE HERE. IN THAT CASE, IF THE COURT RECALLS, ALL THE DEFENSE TRIED TO DO WAS TO CROSS-EXAMINE IN THAT ONE AREA, AND THAT WAS IT.APPARENTLY, THERE WERE NO OTHER AVENUES OPEN TO THE DEFENSE. AND THAT'S BECAUSE, AS THE COURT SAID ON PAGE 506 COMES TO MIND IN THAT CASE, IN RE ANTHONY P., THAT THE ENTIRE CASE RESTED ENTIRELY ON THE CREDIBILITY OF THE COMPLAINING VICTIM, WHO WAS THE VICTIM OF WHAT FACTUALLY APPEARED TO BE A SEXUAL BATTERY.SO THERE WAS NO CORROBORATION, NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE TO CORROBORATE, NO OTHER WITNESSES WHO SAW THE EVENT OR EVEN SAW HER RUN FROM THE EVENT. AND WHEN YOU HAD A ONE-ON-ONE CREDIBILITY CONTEST, THE ANTHONY P. COURT FELT IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO ALLOW THAT.THE SITUATION WE HAVE HERE IS VASTLY DIFFERENT. WE HAVE ABUNDANT EVIDENCE OTHER THAN THE GLOVE AT ROCKINGHAM, WHICH THE COURT IS AWARE OF AND WILL HEAR MORE OF AS TIME GOES BY AND AS THE TRIAL EVOLVES AND CERTAINLY BY THE TIME OPENING STATEMENTS ARE COMPLETED.BUT THIS IS NOT A SITUATION WHERE THIS IS THE SOLE WITNESS, THE VICTIM, THE COMPLAINING WITNESS. THIS IS NOT A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE THE CREDIBILITY OF THE ENTIRE CASE AND THE ENTIRE BASIS OF EVERY ELEMENT OF THE CHARGES IN THAT CASE WHERE ALL OF THAT IS COMING FROM THE MOUTH OF ONE PERSON TESTIFYING FROM THE WITNESS STAND.THIS IS A CASE WHERE, AS THE COURT KNOWS, THERE'S GOING TO BE -- I DON'T WANT TO SAY HUNDREDS, BUT THERE'S GOING TO BE LOTS AND LOTS OF WITNESSES GOING TO VARIOUS DIFFERENT TYPES OF EVIDENCE.AND THE 352 ANALYSIS STILL APPLIES HERE; THAT IT IS SOMETHING THAT REQUIRES DEEP CONSIDERATION AND IT DOES NOT BEHOOVE THE COURT TO ALLOW THE DEFENSE TO RECAST THE TRUE FRAMEWORK OF DETECTIVE FUHRMAN'S TESTIMONY IN TRYING TO TURN IT INTO A CREDIBILITY CONTEST AS IF HE WERE INDEED -- INDEED AS IF HIS CREDIBILITY WERE AT STAKE IN THE SAME WAY THAT IT WAS FOR THAT COMPLAINING VICTIM AND SOLE WITNESS IN THE ANTHONY P. CASE.THEY'RE TRYING TO TWIST THE FACTS OF THIS CASE TO FIT THAT. BUT IN REALITY, THEY DON'T. THIS CASE IS NOT THAT CASE.NOW, THE COURT MENTIONED A SECOND CASE THEY CITED IN SUPPORT OF -- AND I'M NOT SURE. THEY DO CITE ALONG WITH ANTHONY P., WHICH WE PROVIDED THE COURT WITH, LARRY E. VERSUS SUPERIOR COURT.THAT CASE HAD TO DO WITH A PITCHESS MOTION. AND THE PROSECUTION THERE HAD ARGUED THAT THE PERSONNEL RECORDS OF A POLICE OFFICER NOT NAMED AS A VICTIM IN THE COMPLAINT SHOULD NOT BE DISCOVERABLE, AND THE COURT OF APPEAL, I BELIEVE IT WAS, HELD OTHERWISE.THAT WAS FOR PURPOSES OF A PITCHESS MOTION, WHICH, AS THE COURT IS WELL AWARE, A PITCHESS MOTION GOES TO DISCOVERY; AND THE ONLY GROUND FOR DISCOVERY OR THE ONLY REQUIREMENT IS THAT IT BE REASONABLY LIKELY TO LEAD TO ADMISSIBLE EVIDENCE.BUT EVEN IN THIS CASE ITSELF, I THINK THE COURT IN HERE NOTES THAT THEY'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT EVIDENCE THAT WOULD BE ADMISSIBLE AT TRIAL. THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT SIMPLY A DISCOVERY MATTER.AND IN THIS CASE, THE COURT INDEED DID REVIEW THE PERSONNEL DOCUMENTS THAT WERE PROVIDED TO IT. AND I BELIEVE MARK FUHRMAN'S ATTORNEY REQUESTED THE COURT DO THAT. THE COURT DID IT. AND SO IN LIMITED RESPECT, IT LOOKED INTO THE MATTER, DETERMINED THERE WAS NOTHING RELEVANT FROM THOSE RECORDS; AND INDEED THERE WAS NOT.AND THE BOTTOM LINE, YOUR HONOR, IS THAT IT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE TO ALLOW THE DEFENSE TO GO ON A FISHING EXPEDITION RAISING AN INFLAMMATORY ISSUE OF RACIAL ANIMOSITY IN FRONT OF THE JURY WHEN THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT NEXUS, TO PROVIDE THAT NEXUS TO BEGIN WITH.AND WE DO DOVETAIL BACK INTO THE THIRD PARTY CULPABILITY CASE LAW, WHICH REQUIRES SOME EVIDENTIARY LINK PRIOR TO THERE BEING ANY RELEVANCE TO MOTIVE OR OPPORTUNITY EVIDENCE.SO THEY HAVE FAILED TO COMPORT WITH THAT, YOUR HONOR. AND MR. BAILEY, ALTHOUGH HE MAY BE ELOQUENT AND PERHAPS PERSUASIVE TO A TRIER OF FACT, CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT BE PERSUASIVE TO THIS COURT BECAUSE THE COURT HAS BEHIND IT ALL OF THE LAW AND ALL OF THE FACTS IN THIS AREA.AND THE COURT HAS DONE A VERY CAREFUL AND REASONED ANALYSIS, AND I CERTAINLY APPRECIATED THE CAREFULNESS AND THE RULING WHICH THE COURT CAME FORTH WITH WHICH SHOWED THAT THE COURT HAD CAREFULLY THOUGHT OUT THE ISSUE.AND THE DEFENSE HAS SIMPLY FAILED TO DO WHAT THE COURT DECIDED IT WOULD ALLOW; AND THAT WOULD BE A LAST-MINUTE OFFER. IF THEY HAD SOME TRUE EVIDENCE, LET THEM COME FORWARD WITH IT. IT'S SORT OF PUT UP OR SHUT UP. AND THE DEFENSE FRANKLY HAS NOT DONE THAT. THEY HAVE NOT PUT UP, SO THEY SHOULD SHUT UP.

SIMPSON WAS A BUSY MAN, THAT HE WAS TRAVELING, THAT HE WAS DOING OTHER THINGS AND THAT HE IS NOT THE SORT OF ANIMAL THAT THE PEOPLE ARE ATTEMPTING TO PORTRAY.WE ARGUE, YOUR HONOR, THAT THIS CALENDAR WILL SATISFY ALL AUTHENTICATION AND FOUNDATIONAL EVIDENCE. AND IF IT OCCURS THAT WE ARE LEFT AT THE TIME OF MISS RANDA'S TESTIMONY WHERE SHE IS UNABLE TO PROPERLY AUTHENTICATE THIS CALENDAR, IT IS THE DEFENDANT WHO WILL SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES, IT IS THE DEFENDANT WHO WILL SUFFER THE SLINGS AND THE ARROWS OF THE JURY OR LOSE WHATEVER CREDIBILITY THERE MIGHT BE THROUGH THE OFFERING OF ANTICIPATED EVIDENCE THAT WILL NOT ULTIMATELY BE ADMITTED INTO EVIDENCE.THAT'S THE FIRST POINT, YOUR HONOR.THE SECOND POINT, CURIOUSLY, I WAS THE VICTIM, IF YOU WILL, OF TREMENDOUS ANIMUS THIS MORNING THAT I'M SURE DID VIOLENCE TO MY GOOD NAME, TO MY MOTHER AND MY FAMILY ACROSS THE COUNTRY ABOUT HOW I WAS SANDBAGGING THE PROSECUTION THROUGH MY FAILURE TO PROVIDE COPIES OF EVERY BOARD OR EVERY GRAPHIC THAT WE HAD INTENDED TO INTRODUCE AT TRIAL.LO AND BEHOLD, I WAS GIVEN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE NOON SOME BOARDS THAT ARE THE COROLLARY OF THE SANDBAGGING, IF YOU WILL.THERE ARE BOARDS THAT THE PEOPLE SEEK TO INTRODUCE, AND I WAS ABLE TO PERSUADE THEM AS TO THE WISDOM AGAINST SEEKING TO INTRODUCE AT LEAST TWO OR THREE OTHERS. BUT I HAVE FOUR, YOUR HONOR; AND THERE ARE OBJECTIONS THAT I LODGED AS TO THE FOUR.THE FIRST WOULD BE WHAT IS TITLED A CHRONOLOGY. AND, YOUR HONOR, THERE ARE ARGUMENTATIVE DESCRIPTIONS OF DIFFERENT EVENTS IN THIS CHRONOLOGY AND THERE ARE SOME EVENTS INCLUDED THAT THE COURT HAS RULED ARE INADMISSIBLE. AND FOR THESE REASONS, I THINK IT IS FAR MORE PREJUDICIAL THAN PROBATIVE THAT THIS BOARD BE ADMITTED.FOR EXAMPLE, IN 1986, THERE'S A REFERENCE TO THE VICTORIA BEACH INCIDENT. THAT IS AN INCIDENT THAT THE COURT HAS RULED IS NOT ADMISSIBLE.

#THE COURT: ,"NO. THAT'S NOT CORRECT.WHAT I RULED IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE LATE DISCLOSURE, IT CANNOT BE USED DURING THE COURSE OF OPENING STATEMENTS.

#MR. DARDEN: ,"YES, YOUR HONOR.I THINK THE GRAND JURY TRANSCRIPT WILL SPEAK FOR ITSELF. IT WAS HERE A LITTLE WHILE AGO. I'LL HAVE IT BACK HERE TOMORROW MORNING.AS I RECALL, MISS RANDA TOLD THE GRAND JURY THAT SHE HAD THE ORIGINAL CALENDAR. SHE TURNED THAT OVER TO A LAWYER, AND THEN SHE MADE A SECOND COPY OR ATTEMPTED TO MAKE A SECOND COPY FROM THE FIRST.IT'S NOT A XEROX COPY. IT'S A HANDWRITTEN COPY. SO SHE OBTAINED ANOTHER CALENDAR BOOK.IN ADDITION, AS I RECALL, THERE'S ACTUALLY A THIRD CALENDAR WHICH IS TYPED AND WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THIS ONE, BUT WAS FOUND IN MR. COWLING'S BRONCO AS I RECALL AT THE END OF THE CHASE. SO THERE'S ACTUALLY THREE CALENDARS.AND THAT IS NOT THE ORIGINAL.

I THINK WE ALL KNOW AND RESPECT EACH OTHER ON THE BASIS OF OUR PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE AND PRIOR ACQUAINTANCESHIP.I EXPECT TO SEE A VERY HARD-FOUGHT BATTLE. IF TODAY'S PROCEEDING JUST TO GET TO THE OPENING STATEMENTS IS ANY INDICIA OF THAT, I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE ONE OF THE HARDEST FOUGHT LEGAL BATTLES IN MY RECOLLECTION CERTAINLY.I ANTICIPATE THAT BOTH SIDES WILL SPEND A LOT OF TIME WALKING ON THE EDGE OF THE LEGAL ENVELOPE HERE, AND BELIEVE ME, I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO KEEP YOU FROM GOING OVER THAT EDGE. I EXPECT TO SEE A DEMONSTRATION OF ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS LAWYERING SKILLS, BUT I ALSO EXPECT TO SEE ABSOLUTE PROFESSIONALISM IN THIS ENDEAVOR.I WANT YOU ALL TO REMEMBER BEFORE WE START THIS CASE THAT YOUR CONDUCT HERE WILL HAVE AN IMPACT NOT ONLY UPON THE WELFARE OF YOUR RESPECTIVE CLIENTS, BUT UPON THE IMAGE OF OUR PROFESSION FOR MANY YEARS TO COME. THOSE WHO SAY THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ITSELF IS ON TRIAL MAY BE CORRECT IN THAT OBSERVATION.IF YOU RECALL, WHEN WE STARTED THIS TRIAL, I INVITED EACH COUNSEL IN TO CHAMBERS TO CHAT WITH ME. I INDICATED TO YOU THAT I EXPECTED AT THE END OF THIS TRIAL, THAT WE WOULD ALL GO OUT AND HAVE DINNER TOGETHER ON ME AND THAT WE WOULD ALL BE PROFESSIONALS AND BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH EACH ACCORDINGLY, AND THAT INVITATION IS STILL OPEN AND I ANTICIPATE WILL STILL BE OPEN AT THE CLOSE OF THIS TRIAL.

#THE COURT: ,"FIRST OF ALL, I HOPE THIS WILL BE THE LAST TIME THAT I HAVE TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU FOR KEEPING YOU WAITING SO LONG, BUT I SUSPECT THAT WON'T BE TRUE IN THIS CASE.FOR YOUR INFORMATION, I HAD PLANNED ON STARTING WITH YOU THIS MORNING AT 10:00 O'CLOCK. CERTAIN ISSUES WERE RAISED BEFORE ME THAT I HAD TO DEAL WITH, AND AS HAS BEEN MY EXPERIENCE UNFORTUNATELY, MANY OF THESE THINGS TOOK LONGER TO DEAL WITH THAN I HAD ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED.HAD I KNOWN THAT WE WOULD BE THIS LATE GETTING STARTED WITH YOU TODAY, I WOULD NOT HAVE BROUGHT YOU IN TODAY. BUT WE'RE HERE, AND I WOULD LIKE TO USE AS MUCH OF THE COURT TIME AS WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO AT LEAST GET STARTED WITH SOME OF THE PRELIMINARIES.NOW, WHAT WILL HAPPEN TODAY IS, I AM GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME PRELIMINARY INSTRUCTIONS ON THE LAW THAT APPLIES TO THIS CASE.NOW, WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO, AS SOON AS I FINISH DOING THAT IS, WE WILL RECESS FOR THE DAY, AND THEN TOMORROW MORNING AT 10:00 O'CLOCK, WE WILL START WITH THE OPENING STATEMENTS BY THE LAWYERS AND THEN PROCEED TO THE PRESENTATION OF EVIDENCE.NOW, WHAT I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU TODAY ARE PRELIMINARY INSTRUCTIONS. THIS IS SORT OF MY EFFORT TO GIVE YOU A GAUGE OR RULE BY WHICH YOU SHOULD LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE AS IT IS PRESENTED TO YOU.I'M REQUIRED BY THE LAW TO STATE TO YOU THE LAW THAT APPLIES TO THIS CASE HERE IN OPEN COURT. HOWEVER, IT'S ALSO MY PERSONAL POLICY TO MAKE THESE INSTRUCTIONS AVAILABLE TO YOU IN THE JURY ROOM WHEN YOU DO YOUR DELIBERATIONS IN WRITTEN FORM.SO I ENCOURAGE YOU EACH TO LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY TO MY INSTRUCTIONS ON THE LAW. HOWEVER, YOU NEED NOT TAKE ANY DETAILED NOTES AS TO THEIR CONTENTS SINCE THEY WILL BE AVAILABLE TO YOU IN THEIR EXACT WRITTEN FORM IN THE JURY ROOM.LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY:IT IS MY DUTY TO INSTRUCT YOU ON THE LAW THAT APPLIES TO THIS CASE. THE LAW REQUIRES THAT I READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS TO YOU. YOU WILL HAVE THESE INSTRUCTIONS IN WRITTEN FORM IN THE JURY ROOM TO REFER TO DURING YOUR DELIBERATIONS.YOU MUST BASE YOUR DECISION ON THE FACTS AND THE LAW.YOU HAVE TWO DUTIES TO PERFORM. FIRST, YOU MUST DETERMINE THE FACTS FROM THE EVIDENCE RECEIVED IN THE TRIAL AND NOT FROM ANY OTHER SOURCE. A ""FACT"" IS SOMETHING PROVED DIRECTLY OR CIRCUMSTANTIALLY BY THE EVIDENCE OR BY STIPULATION. A STIPULATION IS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE ATTORNEYS REGARDING THE FACTS.SECOND, YOU MUST APPLY THE LAW THAT I STATE TO YOU TO THE FACTS AS YOU DETERMINE THEM AND IN THIS WAY ARRIVE AT YOUR VERDICT AND ANY FINDING YOU ARE INSTRUCTED TO INCLUDE WITH YOUR VERDICT.YOU MUST ACCEPT AND FOLLOW THE LAW AS I STATE IT TO YOU WHETHER OR NOT YOU AGREE WITH THE LAW. IF ANYTHING CONCERNING THE LAW SAID BY THE ATTORNEYS IN THEIR ARGUMENTS OR AT ANY OTHER TIME DURING THE TRIAL CONFLICT WITH MY INSTRUCTIONS ON THE LAW, YOU MUST FOLLOW MY INSTRUCTIONS.YOU MUST NOT BE INFLUENCED BY PITY FOR A DEFENDANT OR BY PREJUDICE AGAINST HIM. YOU MUST NOT BE BIASED AGAINST THE DEFENDANT BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN ARRESTED FOR THIS OFFENSE, CHARGED WITH A CRIME OR BROUGHT TO TRIAL. NONE OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IS EVIDENCE OF GUILT AND YOU MUST NOT INFER OR ASSUME FROM ANY OR ALL OF THEM THAT HE IS MORE LIKELY TO BE GUILTY THAN INNOCENT.YOU MUST NOT BE INFLUENCED BY MERE SENTIMENT, CONJECTURE, SYMPATHY, PASSION, PREJUDICE, PUBLIC OPINION OR PUBLIC FEELING. BOTH THE PROSECUTION AND THE DEFENDANT HAVE A RIGHT TO EXPECT THAT YOU WILL CONSCIENTIOUSLY CONSIDER AND WEIGH THE EVIDENCE, APPLY THE LAW AND REACH A JUST VERDICT REGARDLESS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES.YOU MUST DECIDE THIS CASE SOLELY UPON THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED HERE IN THE COURTROOM. YOU MUST COMPLETELY DISREGARD ANY PRESS, TELEVISION, RADIO OR OTHER MEDIA REPORTS THAT YOU MAY HAVE READ, SEEN OR HEARD CONCERNING THIS CASE OR THE DEFENDANT. THESE REPORTS ARE NOT EVIDENCE AND YOU MUST NOT BE INFLUENCED IN ANY MANNER BY SUCH PUBLICITY.YOU ARE NOT TO DISCUSS AMONG YOURSELVES OR WITH ANYONE ELSE ANY SUBJECT CONNECTED WITH THIS TRIAL. YOU ARE NOT TO FORM OR EXPRESS ANY OPINION ON THE CASE UNTIL THE CASE IS SUBMITTED TO YOU FOR YOUR DELIBERATIONS IN THE JURY ROOM.YOU MUST COMPLETELY DISREGARD ANY PRESS, TELEVISION, RADIO OR OTHER MEDIA REPORTS THAT YOU MAY HAVE READ, SEEN OR HEARD CONCERNING THIS CASE OR THE DEFENDANT. YOU MUST NOT READ OR LISTEN TO ANY ACCOUNTS OR DISCUSSIONS OF THE CASE REPORTED BY NEWSPAPERS OR OTHER NEWS MEDIA.YOU MUST NOT MAKE ANY INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION OF THE FACTS OR THE LAW OR CONSIDER OR DISCUSS FACTS AS TO WHICH THERE IS NO EVIDENCE. THIS MEANS, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT YOU MUST NOT ON YOUR OWN VISIT THE SCENE, CONDUCT EXPERIMENTS OR CONSULT REFERENCE WORKS OR PERSONS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.PRIOR TO AND WITHIN 90 DAYS OF YOUR DISCHARGE, YOU MUST NOT REQUEST, ACCEPT, AGREE TO ACCEPT OR DISCUSS WITH ANY PERSON RECEIVING OR ACCEPTING ANY PAYMENT OR BENEFIT IN CONSIDERATION FOR SUPPLYING ANY INFORMATION CONCERNING THE TRIAL.YOU HAVE A DUTY TO IMMEDIATELY REPORT TO THE COURT ANY ACT OF JUROR MISCONDUCT THAT YOU SEE, HEAR OR LEARN. YOUR FAILURE TO DO SO IS MISCONDUCT IN AND OF ITSELF. IF YOU ARE UNCERTAIN WHETHER A PARTICULAR ACT IS MISCONDUCT, YOU SHOULD REPORT THE ACT AND ALLOW THE COURT TO MAKE THE DETERMINATION.YOU MUST PROMPTLY REPORT TO THE COURT ANY INCIDENT WITHIN YOUR KNOWLEDGE INVOLVING ANY ATTEMPT BY ANY PERSON TO IMPROPERLY INFLUENCE ANY MEMBER OF THE JURY.IF ANY RULE, DIRECTION OR IDEA IS REPEATED OR STATED IN DIFFERENT WAYS IN THESE INSTRUCTIONS, NO EMPHASIS IS INTENDED AND YOU MUST NOT DRAW ANY INFERENCE BECAUSE OF ITS REPETITION. DO NOT SINGLE OUT ANY PARTICULAR SENTENCE OR ANY INDIVIDUAL POINT OR INSTRUCTION AND IGNORE THE OTHERS. CONSIDER THE INSTRUCTIONS AS A WHOLE AND EACH IN LIGHT OF THE OTHERS.THE ORDER IN WHICH THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE GIVEN HAS NO SIGNIFICANCE AS TO THEIR RELATIVE IMPORTANCE.STATEMENTS MADE BY THE ATTORNEYS DURING THE TRIAL ARE NOT EVIDENCE, ALTHOUGH IF THE ATTORNEYS HAVE STIPULATED OR AGREED TO A FACT, YOU MUST REGARD THAT FACT AS CONCLUSIVELY PROVED.IF AN OBJECTION IS SUSTAINED TO A QUESTION, DO NOT GUESS WHAT THE ANSWER MIGHT HAVE BEEN. DO NOT SPECULATE AS TO THE REASON FOR THE OBJECTION.DO NOT ASSUME TO BE TRUE ANY INSINUATION SUGGESTED BY A QUESTION ASKED A WITNESS. A QUESTION IS NOT EVIDENCE AND MAY BE CONSIDERED ONLY AS IT ENABLES YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE ANSWER.DO NOT CONSIDER FOR ANY PURPOSE ANY OFFER OF EVIDENCE THAT WAS REJECTED OR ANY EVIDENCE THAT WAS STRICKEN BY THE COURT. YOU MUST TREAT IT AS THOUGH YOU HAD NEVER HEARD IT.YOU MUST DECIDE ALL QUESTIONS OF FACT IN THIS CASE FROM THE EVIDENCE RECEIVED IN THIS TRIAL AND NOT FROM ANY OTHER SOURCE.YOU MUST NOT MAKE ANY INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION OF THE FACTS OR THE LAW OR CONSIDER OR DISCUSS FACTS AS TO WHICH THERE IS NO EVIDENCE. THIS MEANS, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT YOU MUST NOT ON YOUR OWN, AS I INDICATED, VISIT THE CRIME SCENE, CONDUCT EXPERIMENTS OR CONSULT REFERENCE WORKS OR OTHER PERSONS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.YOU MUST NOT DISCUSS THIS CASE WITH ANY OTHER PERSON EXCEPT A FELLOW JUROR, AND YOU MUST NOT DISCUSS THE CASE WITH A FELLOW JUROR UNTIL THE CASE IS SUBMITTED TO YOU FOR YOUR DECISION, AND THEN ONLY WHEN ALL JURORS ARE PRESENT IN THE JURY ROOM.EVIDENCE CONSISTS OF THE TESTIMONY OF WITNESSES, WRITINGS, MATERIAL OBJECTS OR ANYTHING PRESENTED TO THE SENSES AND OFFERED TO PROVE THE EXISTENCE OR NONEXISTENCE OF A FACT.EVIDENCE IS EITHER DIRECT OR CIRCUMSTANTIAL. DIRECT EVIDENCE IS EVIDENCE THAT DIRECTLY PROVES A FACT WITHOUT THE NECESSITY OF AN INFERENCE. IT'S EVIDENCE, WHICH BY ITSELF, IF FOUND TO BE TRUE, ESTABLISHES THAT FACT.CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE IS EVIDENCE, IF FOUND TO BE TRUE, PROVES A FACT FROM WHICH AN INFERENCE OF EXISTENCE OF ANOTHER FACT MAY BE DRAWN. AN INFERENCE IS A DEDUCTION OF FACT THAT MAY LOGICALLY AND REASONABLY BE DRAWN FROM ANOTHER FACT OR GROUP OF FACTS ESTABLISHED BY THE EVIDENCE.IT IS NOT NECESSARY THAT FACTS BE PROVED BY DIRECT EVIDENCE. THEY MAY BE PROVED ALSO BY CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE OR BY A COMBINATION OF DIRECT EVIDENCE AND CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.BOTH DIRECT EVIDENCE AND CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE ARE ACCEPTABLE AS A MEANS OF PROOF. NEITHER IS ENTITLED TO ANY GREATER WEIGHT THAN THE OTHER.HOWEVER, A FINDING OF GUILT AS TO ANY CRIME MAY NOT BE BASED ON CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE UNLESS THE PROVED CIRCUMSTANCES ARE NOT ONLY, ONE, CONSISTENT WITH THE THEORY THAT THE DEFENDANT IS GUILTY OF THE CRIME, BUT, TWO, CANNOT BE RECONCILED WITH ANY OTHER RATIONAL CONCLUSION.FURTHER, EACH FACT WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO COMPLETE A SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH THE DEFENDANT'S GUILT MUST BE PROVED BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. IN OTHER WORDS, BEFORE AN INFERENCE ESSENTIAL TO ESTABLISH GUILT MAY BE FOUND TO HAVE BEEN PROVED BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT, EACH FACT OR CIRCUMSTANCE UPON WHICH SUCH INFERENCE NECESSARILY RESTS MUST BE PROVED BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT.ALSO, IF THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE AS TO ANY PARTICULAR COUNT IS SUSCEPTIBLE OF TWO REASONABLE INTERPRETATIONS, ONE OF WHICH POINTS TO THE DEFENDANT'S GUILT AND THE OTHER TO HIS INNOCENCE, YOU MUST ADOPT THAT INTERPRETATION WHICH POINTS TO THE DEFENDANT'S INNOCENCE AND REJECT THAT INTERPRETATION WHICH POINTS TO HIS GUILT.IF, ON THE OTHER HAND, ONE INTERPRETATION OF SUCH EVIDENCE APPEARS TO YOU TO BE REASONABLE AND THE OTHER INTERPRETATION TO BE UNREASONABLE, YOU MUST ACCEPT THE REASONABLE INTERPRETATION AND REJECT THE UNREASONABLE.CERTAIN EVIDENCE WILL BE ADMITTED FOR A LIMITED PURPOSE.AT THE TIME THIS EVIDENCE IS ADMITTED, YOU WILL BE ADMONISHED THAT IT CANNOT BE CONSIDERED BY YOU FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN THE LIMITED PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT IS ADMITTED.DO NOT CONSIDER SUCH EVIDENCE FOR ANY PURPOSE EXCEPT THE LIMITED PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT IS ADMITTED.NEITHER SIDE IS REQUIRED TO CALL AS WITNESSES ALL PERSONS WHO MAY HAVE BEEN PRESENT AT ANY OF THE EVENTS DISCLOSED BY THE EVIDENCE OR WHO MAY APPEAR TO HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE OF THESE EVENTS OR TO PRODUCE ALL OBJECTS OR DOCUMENTS MENTIONED OR SUGGESTED BY THE EVIDENCE.EVERY PERSON WHO TESTIFIES UNDER OATH IS A WITNESS. YOU ARE THE SOLE JUDGES OF THE BELIEVABILITY OF A WITNESS AND THE WEIGHT TO BE GIVEN THE TESTIMONY OF EACH WITNESS.IN DETERMINING THE BELIEVABILITY OF A WITNESS, YOU MAY CONSIDER ANYTHING THAT HAS A TENDENCY IN REASON TO PROVE OR DISPROVE THE TRUTHFULNESS OF THE TESTIMONY OF THE WITNESS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY OF THE FOLLOWING:THE EXTENT OF THE OPPORTUNITY OR THE ABILITY OF THE WITNESS TO HEAR, SEE OR OTHERWISE BECOME AWARE OF ANY MATTER ABOUT WHICH THE WITNESS HAS TESTIFIED;THE ABILITY OF THE WITNESS TO REMEMBER OR TO COMMUNICATE ANY MATTER ABOUT WHICH THE WITNESS HAS TESTIFIED;THE CHARACTER AND QUALITY OF THAT TESTIMONY;THE DEMEANOR AND MANNER OF THE WITNESS WHILE TESTIFYING;THE EXISTENCE OR NONEXISTENCE OF A BIAS, INTEREST OR OTHER MOTIVE;EVIDENCE OF THE EXISTENCE OR NONEXISTENCE OF ANY FACT TESTIFIED TO BY THE WITNESS;THE ATTITUDE OF THE WITNESS TOWARD THIS ACTION OR TOWARD THE GIVING OF TESTIMONY;A STATEMENT PREVIOUSLY MADE BY THE WITNESS THAT IS CONSISTENT OR INCONSISTENT WITH THE TESTIMONY OF THE WITNESS;THE CHARACTER OF THE WITNESS FOR HONESTY OR TRUTHFULNESS OR THEIR OPPOSITES;AN ADMISSION BY THE WITNESS OF UNTRUTHFULNESS.DISCREPANCIES IN A WITNESS' TESTIMONY OR BETWEEN HIS AND HER TESTIMONY AND THAT OF OTHERS, IF THERE ARE ANY, DO NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THE WITNESS SHOULD BE DISCREDITED. FAILURE OF RECOLLECTION IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE. INNOCENT MISRECOLLECTION IS NOT UNCOMMON. IT IS ALSO A FACT THAT TWO PERSONS WITNESSING AN INCIDENT OR TRANSACTION OFTEN WILL SEE OR HEAR IT DIFFERENTLY. WHETHER A DISCREPANCY PERTAINS TO A FACT OF IMPORTANCE OR ONLY TO A TRIVIAL DETAIL SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN WEIGHING ITS SIGNIFICANCE.A WITNESS WHO IS WILLFULLY FALSE IN ONE MATERIAL PART OF HIS OR HER TESTIMONY IS TO BE DISTRUSTED IN OTHERS. YOU MAY REJECT THE WHOLE TESTIMONY OF A WITNESS WHO HAS WILLFULLY TESTIFIED FALSELY AS TO A MATERIAL POINT UNLESS, FROM ALL THE EVIDENCE, YOU BELIEVE THE PROBABILITY OF TRUTH FAVORS HIS OR HER TESTIMONY IN OTHER PARTICULARS.YOU ARE NOT BOUND TO DECIDE AN ISSUE OF FACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TESTIMONY OF A NUMBER OF WITNESSES WHICH DOES NOT CONVINCE YOU AS AGAINST THE TESTIMONY OF A LESSER NUMBER OR OTHER EVIDENCE WHICH APPEALS TO YOUR MIND WITH MORE CONVINCING FORCE. YOU MAY NOT DISREGARD THE TESTIMONY OF THE GREATER NUMBER OF WITNESSES MERELY FROM CAPRICE, WHIM OR PREJUDICE OR FROM A DESIRE TO FAVOR ONE SIDE AGAINST THE OTHER.YOU MUST NOT DECIDE AN ISSUE BY THE SIMPLE PROCESS OF COUNTING THE NUMBER OF WITNESSES WHO HAVE TESTIFIED ON THE OPPOSING SIDES. THE FINAL TEST IS NOT IN THE RELATIVE NUMBER OF WITNESSES, BUT IN THE CONVINCING FORCE OF THE EVIDENCE.YOU SHOULD GIVE THE TESTIMONY OF A SINGLE WITNESS WHATEVER WEIGHT YOU THINK IT DESERVES. HOWEVER, THE TESTIMONY BY ONE WITNESS WHICH YOU BELIEVE CONCERNING ANY FACT IS SUFFICIENT FOR THE PROOF OF THAT FACT. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW ALL THE EVIDENCE UPON WHICH THE PROOF OF SUCH FACT DEPENDS.EVIDENCE WILL BE INTRODUCED FOR THE PURPOSE OF SHOWING THAT THE DEFENDANT COMMITTED ACTS OTHER THAN THAT FOR WHICH HE IS ON TRIAL.SUCH EVIDENCE, IF BELIEVED, WILL NOT BE RECEIVED AND MAY NOT BE CONSIDERED BY YOU TO PROVE THAT THE DEFENDANT IS A PERSON OF BAD CHARACTER OR THAT HE HAS A DISPOSITION TO COMMIT CRIMES.SUCH EVIDENCE WILL BE RECEIVED AND MAY BE CONSIDERED BY YOU ONLY FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE OF DETERMINING IF IT TENDS TO SHOW:THE EXISTENCE OF INTENT, WHICH IS A NECESSARY ELEMENT OF THE CRIME CHARGED;THE IDENTITY OF THE PERSON WHO COMMITTED THE CRIME, IF ANY, OF WHICH THE DEFENDANT IS ACCUSED;A MOTIVE FOR THE COMMISSION OF THE CRIME CHARGED; ORA CHARACTERISTIC, METHOD, PLAN OR SCHEME IN THE COMMISSION OF ACTS SIMILAR TO THE METHOD, PLAN OR SCHEME USED IN THE COMMISSION OF THE OFFENSE IN THIS CASE WHICH WOULD FURTHER TEND TO SHOW THE EXISTENCE OF THE INTENT WHICH IS A NECESSARY ELEMENT OF THE CRIME CHARGED;THE IDENTITY OF THE PERSON WHO COMMITTED THE CRIME, IF ANY, OF WHICH THE DEFENDANT IS ACCUSED OR A CLEAR CONNECTION BETWEEN THE OTHER ACT AND THE ONE OF WHICH THE DEFENDANT IS ACCUSED SO THAT IT MAY BE INFERRED THAT IF THE DEFENDANT COMMITTED THE OTHER ACTS, THE DEFENDANT ALSO COMMITTED THE ACTS -- EXCUSE ME -- ALSO COMMITTED THE CRIMES CHARGED IN THIS CASE.FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE FOR WHICH YOU MAY CONSIDER SUCH EVIDENCE, YOU MUST WEIGH IT IN THE SAME MANNER AS YOU DO ALL OTHER EVIDENCE IN THE CASE.YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO CONSIDER SUCH EVIDENCE FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE.WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRECEDING INSTRUCTION, SUCH OTHER ACTS PURPORTEDLY COMMITTED BY THE DEFENDANT MUST BE PROVED BY A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE. YOU MUST NOT CONSIDER SUCH EVIDENCE FOR ANY PURPOSE UNLESS YOU ARE SATISFIED THAT THE DEFENDANT COMMITTED SUCH OTHER ACTS.THE PROSECUTION HAS THE BURDEN OF PROVING THESE FACTS BY A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE.""PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE"" MEANS EVIDENCE THAT HAS MORE CONVINCING FORCE AND GREATER PROBABILITY OF TRUTH THAN THAT OPPOSED TO IT. IF THE EVIDENCE IS SO EVENLY BALANCED THAT YOU ARE UNABLE TO FIND THAT THE EVIDENCE ON EITHER SIDE OF AN ISSUE PREPONDERATES, YOUR FINDING ON THAT ISSUE MUST BE AGAINST THE PARTY WHO HAS THE BURDEN OF PROVING IT.YOU SHOULD CONSIDER ALL OF THE EVIDENCE BEARING UPON EVERY ISSUE REGARDLESS OF WHO PRODUCED IT.MOTIVE IS NOT AN ELEMENT OF THE CRIME CHARGED AND NEED NOT BE SHOWN. HOWEVER, YOU MAY CONSIDER MOTIVE OR LACK OF MOTIVE AS A CIRCUMSTANCE IN THIS CASE. PRESENCE OF MOTIVE MAY TEND TO ESTABLISH GUILT. ABSENCE OF MOTIVE MAY TEND TO ESTABLISH INNOCENCE. YOU WILL THEREFORE GIVE ITS PRESENCE OR ABSENCE, AS THE CASE MAY BE, THE WEIGHT TO WHICH YOU FIND IT TO BE ENTITLED.AN ADMISSION IS A STATEMENT MADE BY THE DEFENDANT OTHER THAN AT HIS TRIAL WHICH DOES NOT BY ITSELF ACKNOWLEDGE HIS GUILT OF THE CRIMES FOR WHICH SUCH DEFENDANT IS ON TRIAL, BUT WHICH STATEMENT TENDS TO PROVE HIS GUILT WHEN CONSIDERED WITH THE REST OF THE EVIDENCE.YOU ARE THE EXCLUSIVE JUDGES AS TO WHETHER THE DEFENDANT MADE AN ADMISSION, AND IF SO, WHETHER SUCH STATEMENT IS TRUE IN WHOLE OR IN PART. IF YOU SHOULD FIND THAT THE DEFENDANT DID NOT MAKE THE STATEMENT, YOU MUST REJECT IT. IF YOU FIND THAT IT IS TRUE IN WHOLE OR IN PART, YOU MAY CONSIDER THAT PART WHICH YOU FIND TO BE TRUE.EVIDENCE OF AN ORAL ADMISSION OF THE DEFENDANT SHOULD BE VIEWED WITH CAUTION.NO PERSON MAY BE CONVICTED OF A CRIMINAL OFFENSE UNLESS THERE IS SOME PROOF OF EACH ELEMENT OF THE CRIME INDEPENDENT OF ANY ADMISSION MADE BY HIM OUTSIDE OF THIS TRIAL.THE IDENTITY OF THE PERSON WHO IS ALLEGED TO HAVE COMMITTED A CRIME IS NOT AN ELEMENT OF THE CRIME. SUCH IDENTITY MAY BE ESTABLISHED BY AN ADMISSION.IN DETERMINING THE WEIGHT TO BE GIVEN AN OPINION EXPRESSED BY ANY WITNESS, YOU SHOULD CONSIDER HIS OR HER CREDIBILITY, THE EXTENT OF HIS OR HER OPPORTUNITY TO PERCEIVE THE MATTERS UPON WHICH HIS OR HER OPINION IS BASED AND THE REASONS, IF ANY, GIVEN FOR IT. YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO ACCEPT SUCH OPINION, BUT SHOULD GIVE IT THE WEIGHT, IF ANY, TO WHICH YOU FIND IT TO BE ENTITLED.A PERSON IS QUALIFIED TO TESTIFY AS AN EXPERT IF HE OR SHE HAS SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE, SKILL, EXPERIENCE, TRAINING OR EDUCATION SUFFICIENT TO QUALIFY HIM OR HER AS AN EXPERT ON THE SUBJECT TO WHICH HIS OR HER TESTIMONY RELATES.A DULY QUALIFIED EXPERT MAY GIVE AN OPINION ON QUESTIONS IN CONTROVERSY AT A TRIAL. TO ASSIST YOU IN DECIDING SUCH QUESTIONS, YOU MAY CONSIDER THE OPINION WITH THE REASONS GIVEN FOR IT, IF ANY, BY THE EXPERT WHO GIVES THE OPINION. YOU MAY ALSO CONSIDER THE QUALIFICATIONS AND CREDIBILITY OF THE EXPERT.YOU ARE NOT BOUND TO ACCEPT AN EXPERT OPINION AS CONCLUSIVE, BUT SHOULD GIVE TO IT THE WEIGHT TO WHICH YOU FIND IT TO BE ENTITLED. YOU MAY DISREGARD ANY SUCH OPINION IF YOU FIND IT TO BE UNREASONABLE.IN EXAMINING AN EXPERT WITNESS, COUNSEL MAY PROPOUND TO HIM OR HER A TYPE OF QUESTION KNOWN IN THE LAW AS A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION. BY SUCH A QUESTION, THE WITNESS IS ASKED TO ASSUME TO BE TRUE A SET OF FACTS AND TO GIVE AN OPINION BASED UPON THAT ASSUMPTION.IN PERMITTING SUCH A QUESTION, THE COURT DOES NOT RULE AND DOES NOT NECESSARILY FIND THAT ALL THE ASSUMED FACTS HAVE BEEN PROVED. IT ONLY DETERMINES THAT THOSE ASSUMED FACTS ARE WITHIN THE PROBABLE OR POSSIBLE RANGE OF THE EVIDENCE.IT IS FOR YOU, THE JURY, TO FIND FROM ALL THE EVIDENCE WHETHER OR NOT THE FACTS ASSUMED IN A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION HAVE BEEN PROVED. IF YOU SHOULD FIND THAT ANY ASSUMPTION IN SUCH QUESTION HAS NOT BEEN PROVED, YOU ARE TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF THAT FAILURE OF PROOF ON THE VALUE AND WEIGHT OF THE EXPERT OPINION BASED UPON THE ASSUMED FACTS.IN RESOLVING ANY CONFLICT THAT MAY EXIST IN THE TESTIMONY OF EXPERT WITNESSES, YOU SHOULD WEIGH THE OPINION OF ONE EXPERT AGAINST THAT OF ANOTHER. IN DOING THIS, YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE RELATIVE QUALIFICATIONS AND CREDIBILITY OF THE EXPERT WITNESSES AS WELL AS THE REASONS FOR EACH OPINION AND THE FACTS OR OTHER MATTERS UPON WHICH IT WAS BASED.A DEFENDANT IN A CRIMINAL ACTION IS PRESUMED TO BE INNOCENT UNTIL THE CONTRARY IS PROVED, AND IN CASE OF A REASONABLE DOUBT WHETHER HIS GUILT IS SATISFACTORILY SHOWN, HE IS ENTITLED TO A VERDICT OF NOT GUILTY. THIS PRESUMPTION PLACES UPON THE PROSECUTION THE BURDEN OF PROVING HIM GUILTY BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT.REASONABLE DOUBT IS DEFINED AS FOLLOWS:IT IS NOT A MERE POSSIBLE DOUBT BECAUSE EVERYTHING RELATING TO HUMAN AFFAIRS IS OPEN TO SOME POSSIBLE OR IMAGINARY DOUBT.IT IS THAT STATE OF THE CASE WHICH, AFTER THE ENTIRE COMPARISON AND CONSIDERATION OF ALL THE EVIDENCE, LEAVES THE MINDS OF THE JURORS IN THAT CONDITION THAT THEY CANNOT SAY THEY FEEL AN ABIDING CONVICTION OF THE TRUTH OF THE CHARGE.IN THE CRIMES CHARGED IN COUNTS 1 AND 2, THERE MUST EXIST A UNION OR JOINT OPERATION OF ACT OR CONDUCT AND A CERTAIN MENTAL STATE IN THE MIND OF THE PERPETRATOR. UNLESS SUCH MENTAL STATE EXISTS, THE CRIME TO WHICH IT RELATES IS NOT COMMITTED.THE MENTAL STATE REQUIRED IS INCLUDED IN THE DEFINITION OF THE CRIMES SET FORTH ELSEWHERE IN MY INSTRUCTIONS.THE DEFENDANT IN THIS CASE WILL INTRODUCE EVIDENCE FOR THE PURPOSE OF SHOWING THAT HE WAS NOT PRESENT AT THE TIME AND PLACE OF THE COMMISSION OF THE ALLEGED CRIME FOR WHICH HE IS HERE ON TRIAL. IF, AFTER CONSIDERATION OF ALL THE EVIDENCE, YOU HAVE A REASONABLE DOUBT THAT THE DEFENDANT WAS PRESENT AT THE TIME THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED, YOU MUST FIND HIM NOT GUILTY.THE DEFENDANT IS ACCUSED IN COUNTS 1 AND 2 OF HAVING COMMITTED THE CRIME OF MURDER, A VIOLATION OF PENAL CODE SECTION 187.EVERY PERSON WHO UNLAWFULLY KILLS A HUMAN BEING WITH MALICE AFORETHOUGHT IS GUILTY OF THE CRIME OF MURDER, IN VIOLATION OF SECTION 187 OF THE PENAL CODE.IN ORDER TO PROVE SUCH CRIME, EACH OF THE FOLLOWING ELEMENTS MUST BE PROVED:1. A HUMAN BEING WAS KILLED.2. THE KILLING WAS UNLAWFUL.3. THE KILLING WAS DONE WITH MALICE AFORETHOUGHT.""MALICE"" MAY BE EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.MALICE IS EXPRESS WHEN THERE IS MANIFESTED AN INTENTION UNLAWFULLY TO KILL A HUMAN BEING.MALICE IS IMPLIED WHEN:1. THE KILLING RESULTED FROM AN INTENTIONAL ACT,2. THE NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF THE ACT ARE DANGEROUS TO HUMAN LIFE, AND3. THE ACT WAS DELIBERATELY PERFORMED WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THE DANGER TO AND WITH CONSCIOUS DISREGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE.WHEN IT IS SHOWN THAT A KILLING RESULTED FROM THE INTENTIONAL DOING OF AN ACT WITH EXPRESS OR IMPLIED MALICE, NO OTHER MENTAL STATE NEED BE SHOWN TO ESTABLISH THE MENTAL STATE OF MALICE AFORETHOUGHT.THE MENTAL STATE CONSTITUTING MALICE AFORETHOUGHT DOES NOT NECESSARILY REQUIRE ANY ILL WILL OR HATRED OF THE PERSON KILLED.THE WORD ""AFORETHOUGHT"" DOES NOT IMPLY DELIBERATION OR THE LAPSE OF CONSIDERABLE TIME. IT ONLY MEANS THAT THE REQUIRED MENTAL STATE MUST PRECEDE RATHER THAN FOLLOW THE ACT.ALL MURDER WHICH IS PERPETRATED BY ANY KIND OF WILLFUL, DELIBERATE AND PREMEDITATED KILLING WITH EXPRESS MALICE AFORETHOUGHT IS MURDER OF THE FIRST DEGREE.THE WORD ""WILLFUL"" AS USED IN THIS INSTRUCTION MEANS INTENTIONAL.THE WORD ""DELIBERATE"" MEANS FORMED OR ARRIVED AT OR DETERMINED UPON AS A RESULT OF CAREFUL THOUGHT AND WEIGHING OF CONSIDERATIONS FOR AND AGAINST THE PROPOSED COURSE OF ACTION. THE WORD ""PREMEDITATED"" MEANS CONSIDERED BEFOREHAND.IF YOU FIND THAT THE KILLING WAS PRECEDED AND ACCOMPANIED BY A CLEAR, DELIBERATE INTENT ON THE PART OF THE DEFENDANT TO KILL WHICH WAS THE RESULT OF DELIBERATION AND PREMEDITATION, SO THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN FORMED UPON PREEXISTING REFLECTION AND NOT ON A SUDDEN HEAT OF PASSION OR OTHER CONDITION PRECLUDING THE IDEA OF DELIBERATION, IT IS MURDER OF THE FIRST DEGREE.THE LAW DOES NOT UNDERTAKE TO MEASURE IN UNITS OF TIME THE LENGTH OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE THOUGHT MUST BE PONDERED BEFORE IT CAN RIPEN INTO AN INTENT TO KILL WHICH IS TRULY DELIBERATE AND PREMEDITATED. THE TIME WILL VARY WITH DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS AND UNDER VARYING CIRCUMSTANCES.THE TRUE TEST IS NOT DURATION OF TIME, BUT RATHER THE EXTENT OF REFLECTION. A COLD, CALCULATED JUDGMENT AND DECISION MAY BE ARRIVED AT IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, BUT A MERE UNCONSIDERED AND RASH IMPULSE, EVEN THOUGH IT INCLUDE AN INTENT TO KILL, IS NOT SUCH DELIBERATION AND PREMEDITATION AS WILL FIX AN UNLAWFUL KILLING AS MURDER OF THE FIRST DEGREE.TO CONSTITUTE A DELIBERATE AND PREMEDITATED KILLING, THE SLAYER MUST WEIGH AND CONSIDER THE QUESTION OF KILLING AND THE REASONS FOR AND AGAINST SUCH CHOICE AND, HAVING IN MIND THE CONSEQUENCES, HE DECIDES TO AND DOES KILL.MURDER OF THE SECOND DEGREE IS THE UNLAWFUL KILLING OF A HUMAN BEING WITH MALICE AFORETHOUGHT WHEN THERE IS MANIFESTED AN INTENTION UNLAWFULLY TO KILL A HUMAN BEING BUT THE EVIDENCE IS INSUFFICIENT TO ESTABLISH DELIBERATION AND PREMEDITATION.MURDER IS CLASSIFIED INTO TWO DEGREES, AND IF YOU SHOULD FIND THE DEFENDANT GUILTY OF MURDER, YOU MUST DETERMINE WHETHER YOU FIND THE MURDER TO BE OF THE FIRST OR SECOND DEGREE.IF YOU FIND THE DEFENDANT IN THIS CASE GUILTY OF MURDER OF THE FIRST DEGREE, YOU MUST THEN DECIDE IF THE FOLLOWING SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE IS TRUE OR NOT TRUE:THE DEFENDANT HAS IN THIS PROCEEDING BEEN CONVICTED OF MORE THAN ONE OFFENSE OF MURDER IN THE FIRST OR SECOND DEGREE.THE PROSECUTION HAS THE BURDEN OF PROVING THE TRUTH OF A SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE. IF YOU SHOULD HAVE A REASONABLE DOUBT AS TO WHETHER A SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE IS TRUE, YOU MUST FIND IT TO BE NOT TRUE.TO FIND THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE, REFERRED TO IN THESE INSTRUCTIONS AS MULTIPLE MURDER CONVICTIONS, IS TRUE, IT MUST BE PROVED:THE DEFENDANT HAS IN THIS CASE BEEN CONVICTED OF AT LEAST ONE CRIME OF MURDER OF THE FIRST DEGREE AND ONE OR MORE CRIMES OF MURDER OF THE FIRST OR SECOND DEGREE.IN YOUR DELIBERATIONS, THE SUBJECT OF PENALTY OR PUNISHMENT IS NOT TO BE DISCUSSED OR CONSIDERED BY YOU. THAT IS A MATTER WHICH MUST NOT IN ANY WAY AFFECT YOUR VERDICT OR AFFECT YOUR FINDING AS TO THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE ALLEGED IN THIS CASE.IT IS ALLEGED IN COUNTS 1 AND 2 THAT IN THE COMMISSION OF THE CRIME CHARGED, THE DEFENDANT PERSONALLY USED A DEADLY OR DANGEROUS WEAPON.IF YOU FIND SUCH DEFENDANT GUILTY OF THE CRIME THUS CHARGED, YOU MUST DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DEFENDANT PERSONALLY USED A DANGEROUS OR DEADLY WEAPON IN THE COMMISSION OF SUCH CRIMES.A DEADLY OR DANGEROUS WEAPON MEANS ANY WEAPON, INSTRUMENT OR OBJECT THAT IS CAPABLE OF BEING USED TO INFLICT GREAT BODILY INJURY OR DEATH.THE TERM ""USED A DEADLY OR DANGEROUS WEAPON"" AS USED IN THIS INSTRUCTION MEANS TO DISPLAY SUCH WEAPON IN AN INTENTIONALLY MENACING MANNER OR INTENTIONALLY TO STRIKE OR HIT A HUMAN BEING WITH IT.THE PROSECUTION HAS THE BURDEN OF PROVING THE TRUTH OF THIS ALLEGATION. IF YOU HAVE A REASONABLE DOUBT THAT IT IS TRUE, YOU MUST FIND IT TO BE NOT TRUE.THE ATTITUDE AND CONDUCT OF JURORS AT ALL TIMES IS VERY IMPORTANT. YOU ARE NOT TO DISCUSS AMONGST YOURSELVES OR WITH ANY OTHER PERSON ANY SUBJECT CONNECTED WITH THIS TRIAL. YOU ARE NOT TO FORM OR EXPRESS ANY OPINION ON THE CASE UNTIL THE CASE IS SUBMITTED TO YOU FOR DELIBERATIONS IN THE JURY ROOM. REMEMBER THAT YOU ARE NOT PARTISANS OR ADVOCATES IN THIS MATTER. YOU ARE THE IMPARTIAL JUDGES OF THE FACTS.YOU WILL BE GIVEN NOTEBOOKS AND PENCILS FOR YOUR USE DURING THE COURSE OF THE TRIAL. YOU ARE TO LEAVE THEM ON YOUR SEAT WHEN YOU LEAVE EACH DAY AND AT EACH RECESS. YOU WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE THEM INTO THE JURY ROOM FOR YOUR DELIBERATIONS.A WORD OF CAUTION ABOUT NOTE-TAKING:YOU MAY TAKE NOTES; HOWEVER, YOU SHOULD NOT PERMIT NOTE-TAKING TO DISTRACT YOU FROM THE ONGOING PROCEEDINGS. REMEMBER YOU ARE THE JUDGES OF THE CREDIBILITY OF THE WITNESSES.FURTHER, NOTES ARE ONLY AN AID TO MEMORY AND SHOULD NOT TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER INDEPENDENT RECOLLECTION. A JUROR WHO DOES NOT TAKE NOTES SHOULD RELY UPON HIS OR HER INDEPENDENT RECOLLECTION OF THE EVIDENCE AND NOT BE INFLUENCED BY THE FACT THAT OTHER JURORS DO TAKE NOTES. NOTES ARE FOR THE NOTE-TAKER'S OWN PERSONAL USE IN REFRESHING HIS OR HER RECOLLECTION OF THE EVIDENCE.FINALLY, SHOULD ANY DISCREPANCY EXIST BETWEEN A JUROR'S RECOLLECTION OF THE EVIDENCE AND HIS OR HER NOTES, HE OR SHE MAY REQUEST THAT THE REPORTER READ BACK THE RELEVANT PROCEEDINGS, AND THE TRIAL TRANSCRIPT MUST PREVAIL OVER THE NOTES.THE PURPOSE OF THE COURT'S INSTRUCTIONS IS TO PROVIDE YOU WITH THE APPLICABLE LAW SO THAT YOU MAY ARRIVE AT A JUST AND LAWFUL VERDICT. WHETHER SOME OF THE INSTRUCTIONS APPLY WILL DEPEND UPON WHAT YOU FIND TO BE THE FACTS. DISREGARD ANY INSTRUCTION WHICH APPLIES TO FACTS DETERMINED BY YOU NOT TO EXIST. DO NOT CONCLUDE THAT BECAUSE AN INSTRUCTION HAS BEEN GIVEN THAT I AM EXPRESSING AN OPINION AS TO THE FACTS.I DO NOT INTEND BY ANYTHING THAT I SAY OR DO OR BY ANY QUESTIONS THAT I MAY ASK OR BY ANY RULING THAT I MAY MAKE DURING THE COURSE OF THIS TRIAL TO INTIMATE OR TO SUGGEST TO YOU WHAT YOU SHOULD FIND TO BE THE FACTS OR THAT I BELIEVE OR DISBELIEVE ANY OF THE WITNESSES WHO TESTIFY HERE IN COURT.IF ANYTHING THAT I DO OR SAY SEEMS TO SO INDICATE, YOU WILL DISREGARD IT AND FORM YOUR OWN OPINION.ALL RIGHT.LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THIS CONCLUDES MY PRELIMINARY INSTRUCTIONS TO YOU ON THE LAW AS IT APPLIES TO THIS CASE.WE ARE GOING TO STAND IN RECESS NOW UNTIL TOMORROW MORNING AT 10:00 O'CLOCK WHEN WE WILL PROCEED TO THE OPENING STATEMENTS BY THE ATTORNEYS.ALL RIGHT.COUNSEL, WHY DON'T YOU BE SEATED, PLEASE.ALL RIGHT.LET'S EXCUSE THE JURY, PLEASE.HELD IN OPEN COURT, OUT OF THEPRESENCE OF THE JURY:)

#MR. UELMEN: ,"YOUR HONOR, THE FIRST OBJECTION INTERPOSED BY THE PEOPLE IS THAT THIS HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE, AND WE HAVE LOCATED AT LEAST TWO CALIFORNIA PRECEDENTS WHERE IT HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE.THE FIRST CAME IN PROBABLY THE FIRST CASE OF THE CENTURY OF THE CENTURY, WHICH WAS THE TRIAL OF CLARENCE DARROW HERE IN LOS ANGELES FOR JURY BRIBERY. EVEN THOUGH MR. DARROW WAS REPRESENTED BY EMINENT COUNSEL, EARL ROGERS, HE WAS ALLOWED TO DIRECTLY PARTICIPATE IN THE PRESENTATION OF THE OPENING STATEMENT AND CLOSING ARGUMENT TO THE JURY.THE SECOND EXAMPLE CAME IN 1972 IN THE TRIAL OF ANGELA DAVIS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IN WHICH, ALTHOUGH SHE WAS REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL, SHE ALSO WAS ALLOWED TO PRESENT OPENING REMARKS TO THE JURY.SO IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF PROPOSING SOMETHING THAT HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE AS TO WHICH THERE IS NO PRECEDENT.THE SECOND OBJECTION RAISED BY THE PEOPLE IS THAT THEY WILL BE DEPRIVED OF THEIR RIGHT OF CROSS-EXAMINATION, AND I THINK THAT REALLY MISCONCEIVES WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED HERE.FIRST OF ALL, MR. SIMPSON WILL NOT BE TESTIFYING, AND THE STANDARD INSTRUCTION GIVEN TO THE JURY WITH RESPECT TO ALL OF COUNSEL'S OPENING STATEMENTS THAT THEY ARE NOT EVIDENCE AND NOT TO BE CONSIDERED AS EVIDENCE BY THE JURY WILL CERTAINLY APPLY AS WELL TO MR. SIMPSON'S OPENING REMARKS.BUT WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED REALLY IS NOT A PRESENTATION IN THE TRADITIONAL FORM OF AN OPENING STATEMENT. WHAT WE ARE SIMPLY PROPOSING IS THAT MR. SIMPSON BE ALLOWED TO INTRODUCE HIMSELF TO THE JURORS, TO INTRODUCE THE DEFENSE TEAM, THE LAWYERS WHO ARE REPRESENTING HIM, AND TO SIMPLY REITERATE HIS PLEA OF NOT GUILTY.NOW, OF COURSE THE PROSECUTION HAS NO OPPORTUNITY TO CROSS-EXAMINE A PLEA AND WE BELIEVE IT WOULD BE QUITE APPROPRIATE FOR THE JURY TO HEAR THE PLEA OF NOT GUILTY THAT SETS THIS TRIAL IN MOTION DIRECTLY FROM THE LIPS OF THE DEFENDANT.THIS IS NOT REALLY ALL THAT REMARKABLE A REQUEST. WHAT IT REALLY SEEKS TO DO IS TO FOCUS THE ATTENTION OF THE JURY BACK WHERE IT BELONGS IN THE MIDST OF ALL OF THIS HOOPLA, AND THAT IS ON THE DEFENDANT WHO IS ON TRIAL, TO REMIND THEM THAT WHAT IS REALLY AT STAKE IN THIS TRIAL IS ONE MAN'S FREEDOM. WE WANT THEM TO SEE WHO THAT MAN IS. WE WANT THEM TO HEAR FROM HIM VERY BRIEFLY IN TERMS OF INTRODUCING HIMSELF, INTRODUCING COUNSEL AND REITERATING HIS PLEA.THE SECOND PART OF THE MOTION SIMPLY ADDRESSES A PHYSICAL DEMONSTRATION THAT IS ROUTINELY DONE IN TRIALS, ROUTINELY DONE BY THE PROSECUTION AS WELL AS THE DEFENSE, AND AGAIN WOULD NOT INVOLVE ANY TESTIMONY, BUT SIMPLY A PREVIEW OF EVIDENCE THAT WILL BE PRESENTED IN THE COURSE OF THE TRIAL.

","JANUARY 24, 1995 ",9:09 A.M.
#MS. CLARK: ,"FIRST OF ALL, THIS IS NOT AN OPENING THAT COUNSEL PROPOSES, IT IS SIMPLY AN ATTEMPT TO CAPITALIZE ON WHATEVER DEFENDANT'S STAR APPEAL CURRENTLY IS WITH THE JURY AND TO GET HIM TO HAVE CLOSE PROXIMITY WITH THEM TO IMPRESS THEM.WHAT IS THE PROBATIVE VALUE OF A SCAR? WHAT DOES IT PROVE TO THIS JURY IN TERMS OF HIS PHYSICAL CAPABILITIES ON THE NIGHT OF JUNE THE 12TH, 1994? IT PROVES NOTHING.IN FACT, WE ALL KNOW THAT THE MORNING OF JUNE THE 12TH HE WAS PLAYING GOLF. WE ALSO KNOW THAT WITHIN WEEKS BEFORE THE MURDER HE MADE AN EXERCISE VIDEO, SO THE PROBATIVE VALUE OF THAT SCAR IS NIL AND THE MISLEADING NATURE OF PRESENTING THAT SCAR TO THE JURY IS GREAT.THE INFERENCE THAT THE DEFENSE WILL SEEK TO DRAW FROM THAT SCAR IS THAT HE WAS INCAPABLE OF CERTAIN PHYSICAL ACTS.IF THAT IS WHAT THEY INTEND TO PRESENT, THAT IS FINE. LET THEM PRESENT TESTIMONY THAT IS CAPABLE OF CROSS-EXAMINATION. BUT TO HAVE THE DEFENDANT ESSENTIALLY TESTIFY BEFORE THE JURY WITHOUT TAKING THE WITNESS STAND AND BEING CROSS-EXAMINED IS INAPPROPRIATE.THE CASES IN WHICH THE DEFENDANTS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ADDRESS THE JURY IN OPENING STATEMENT IN PREVIOUS OCCASIONS HAVE BEEN CASES WHERE THE DEFENDANT WAS ACTING IN PRO PER. THIS DEFENDANT IS NOT IN PRO PER. HE IS REPRESENTED BY MANY ATTORNEYS.IF HE DESIRES TO TESTIFY BEFORE THIS JURY, THEN LET HIM DO SO AS ALL WITNESSES DO ON THE WITNESS STAND AND BE SUBJECT TO FULL AND COMPLETE CROSS-EXAMINATION.CASE LAW IS COMPLETELY IN FAVOR OF THE PEOPLE'S POSITION IN THIS REGARD. PEOPLE VERSUS PEREZ, 216 CAL.APP.3D 346, IN WHICH THE DEFENDANT REQUESTED TO BE ALLOWED TO EXHIBIT HIS TATTOOS WITHOUT BEING SWORN OR GIVING TESTIMONY. THE COURT REFUSED HIS REQUEST AND RULED THAT THE EXHIBITION OF THE TATTOO WOULD BE TESTIMONIAL IF OFFERED TO IMPEACH THE TESTIMONY OF AN UNDERCOVER OFFICER, AND ESSENTIALLY THAT IS WHAT THE INJURIES NOW BEING PROPOSED TO BE DISPLAYED TO THE JURY IS BEING OFFERED TO SHOW, THAT HE COULD NOT IN FACT COMMIT CERTAIN ACTS THAT HE IS CHARGED WITH COMMITTING.IT IS TESTIMONIAL IN NATURE. LET'S MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT THAT. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OTHERWISE OF DEMONSTRATING THE SCAR OR OF TALKING ABOUT OR SHOWING THE JURY WHAT HE CAN AND CANNOT DO? IT IS GOING TO GIVE HIM THE ABILITY TO LIMP UP TO THE JURY BOX, GET CLOSE TO THE JURY AND TRY AND IMPRESS THEM WITH HIS PHYSICAL PRESENCE.THIS IS NOT APPROPRIATE AND THERE IS NO LEGAL BENEFIT TO THIS IN TERMS OF WHAT IS APPROPRIATE IN A COURT OF LAW.IF THE DEFENDANT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY, THAT IS FINE, BUT TO DO THIS AND THEN SHIELD HIMSELF FROM CROSS-EXAMINATION, SAY, DON'T ASK ME ANY QUESTIONS, I JUST WANT TO GET UP THERE AND SHOW YOU SOMETHING, I WANT YOU TO DRAW INFERENCES FROM THIS, I WANT YOU TO TAKE EVIDENCE FROM THIS WITHOUT BEING SUBJECT TO CROSS-EXAMINATION, IS ENTIRELY INAPPROPRIATE.THE PEOPLE WOULD NOT BE ENTITLED TO DO THAT BECAUSE THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE A FOUNDATION LAID.PEOPLE VERSUS PEREZ MAKES THAT VERY CLEAR. IT INDICATED THAT IT WOULD BE IRRELEVANT AS DEMONSTRATIVE EVIDENCE AS WELL, WHICH IS WHAT THE DEFENSE CLAIMS IT IS PROPOSING HERE, ALTHOUGH THE PEOPLE DISPUTE THAT AND REALLY IT IS A TESTIMONIAL IN NATURE KIND OF THING THEY ARE PROPOSING.NEVERTHELESS, EVEN IF IT DEMONSTRATIVE, THE COURT IN PEREZ RULED THAT BECAUSE THE DEFENDANT HAD LAID NO FOUNDATION FOR THE ADMISSION OF THE EVIDENCE, IT WAS APPROPRIATELY DENIED.IN THIS CASE AS WELL WHAT THE DEFENDANT PROPOSES TO DO REQUIRES EITHER HIS PRESENCE ON THE WITNESS STAND OR SOME TESTIMONY FROM THE WITNESS STAND TO LAY A FOUNDATION FOR ITS ADMISSION. TO SIMPLY DISPLAY SOMETHING TO THE JURY WITHOUT ANY EVIDENTIARY BASIS GIVES THEM NOTHING RELIABLE AND NOTHING OF PROBATIVE VALUE. IT IS ONLY A BLATANT ATTEMPT TO IMPRESS THE JURY WITH HIS CHARISMA AND STAR APPEAL. THAT IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE VEHICLE IN THE OPENING STATEMENT.LET ME INDICATE ALSO THAT THE CASE OF PEOPLE VERSUS WONG HELD SIMILARLY. IN PEOPLE VERSUS WONG THE TRIAL COURT INDICATED THAT IT WAS IMPROPER TO HAVE THE DEFENDANT EXHIBIT HIS ARMS TO THE JURY WITHOUT FIRST BEING SWORN AS A WITNESS.IN THAT CASE 35 CAL.APP.3D 812, THE DEFENDANT IN THAT CASE WANTED TO INDICATE THAT HE WAS NOT AN ADDICT, HE HAD NO TRACK MARKS ON HIS ARMS. THE TRIAL COURT REFUSED TO ALLOW HIM TO DO SO UNLESS HE SUBJECTED HIMSELF TO CROSS-EXAMINATION.ON APPEAL THE COURT WAS UPHELD AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IF IT WAS A TESTIMONIAL -- IF IT WAS BEING OFFERED AS TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE IT WAS PROPERLY REFUSED WHEN THE DEFENDANT DECLINED TO BE SWORN AS A WITNESS AND SUBJECT HIMSELF TO CROSS-EXAMINATION.IT ALSO RULED THAT IF THE OFFER WAS A DEMONSTRATIVE ONE, THEN THE TRIAL COURT WAS JUSTIFIED IN REJECTING IT ON THE BASIS THAT IT WAS IRRELEVANT. AS I HAVE INDICATED TO THE COURT YESTERDAY, HIS ARM WAS BEING OFFERED ON MAY 12, 1971, TO SHOW THE CONDITION OF HIS ARM ON JUNE 5TH, 1970.THE DEFENDANT'S CONDITION TODAY OR THE EXISTENCE OF THAT SCAR, WITHOUT LAYING A FOUNDATION AS TO WHAT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT SCAR AND HOW IT IMPACTED ON HIS PHYSICAL CAPABILITIES, IS SOMETHING THAT EXISTS WITHOUT FOUNDATION. IT HAS NO PROBATIVE VALUE IN AND OF ITSELF.IF THE DEFENSE WANTS TO DO IT AS PART OF AN OPENING STATEMENT, THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO ALSO PROFFER SOMETHING THAT LENDS IT SOME VALUE IN TERMS OF PROBATIVE VALUE. WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THEY CAN OFFER A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE DEFENDANT'S KNEE, BUT SIMPLY HOLDING A PHOTOGRAPH UP ISN'T GOING TO GET THEM VERY MUCH, SHOULDN'T, BUT THE DEFENDANT -- IN TERMS OF ITS EVIDENTIARY WEIGHT, BECAUSE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN TERMS OF HIS PHYSICAL CAPABILITIES OR HIS LIMITATIONS?HAVING THE DEFENDANT AS WELL GET UP TO TELL THE JURY THAT HE IS NOT GUILTY IS ANOTHER ATTEMPT, BLATANT ATTEMPT TO HAVE THE DEFENDANT ADDRESS THE JURY WITHOUT BEING CROSS-EXAMINED. IT IS LIKE ISSUING A BLANKET DENIAL AND THEN SAYING YOU CAN'T ASK ME ANY QUESTIONS.IN A COURT OF LAW, YOUR HONOR, WHEN A DEFENDANT SEEKS TO TESTIFY AND AN ISSUES A BLANKET DENIAL, THAT OPENS THE DOORS TO CROSS-EXAMINATION AS WIDE AS THEY CAN GO AND THE PEOPLE ARE PERMITTED VERY FAR AND WIDE-RANGING CROSS-EXAMINATION.THE DEFENDANT SEEKS TO DO THAT IN THIS CASE AND PRECLUDE ALL CROSS-EXAMINATION. HE SEEKS TO PROTEST HIS INNOCENCE AND YET NOT ALLOW ANYONE TO ASK HIM ANY QUESTIONS. THAT IS ENTIRELY INAPPROPRIATE, AND THE COURT I'M SURE IS VERY WELL AWARE OF THAT.IF HE WAS IN PRO PER, HE COULD GET UP AND SAY WHATEVER HE WANTED TO; HE IS NOT.

#MR. UELMEN: ,"THE SUGGESTION THAT A PLEA OF NOT GUILTY SUBJECTS A DEFENDANT TO CROSS-EXAMINATION IS SIMPLY NOT THE LAW. THE PLEA OF NOT GUILTY IS WHAT SETS THIS TRIAL IN MOTION AND PUTS THE BURDEN ON THE PEOPLE OF PROVING GUILT BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT.IT IS REALLY INCREDIBLE TO SUGGEST THAT SOMEHOW THE JURORS WILL BE PREJUDICED BY ACTUALLY HEARING THE PLEA OF NOT GUILTY FROM THE MOUTH OF THE DEFENDANT HIMSELF. ACTUALLY, THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN ENTER THE PLEA IS THE DEFENDANT HIMSELF AND THAT PLEA IS WHAT SETS THESE PROCEEDINGS IN MOTION.AND WE ALSO BELIEVE IT IS QUITE APPROPRIATE AND DOES NOT OPEN UP ANY DOORS TO CROSS-EXAMINATION SIMPLY TO HAVE THE JURY OBSERVE THE DEFENDANT AND HEAR HIS PLEA OF NOT GUILTY FROM HIS OWN LIPS.THE SUGGESTION THAT THIS IS SOME SORT OF PLOY TO CAPITALIZE ON THE DEFENDANT'S CHARISMA OR CELEBRITY STATUS, IT IS JUST THE OPPOSITE. IT IS JUST THE OPPOSITE. WE DO NOT WANT THIS JURY TO VIEW THE DEFENDANT IN TERMS OF A CELEBRITY. WE WANT THEM TO VIEW HIM AS A HUMAN BEING, AND THAT SUGGESTS THE GREATER NEED IN THIS CASE TO DO IT, BECAUSE THERE IS JUST SO MUCH STAR STRUCK QUALITY ABOUT THIS -- ABOUT THIS WHOLE PROCEEDING AND WE THINK IT WOULD BE VERY HEALTHY TO REMIND EVERYONE, ESPECIALLY THE JURY, THAT WHAT IS AT STAKE HERE IS SIMPLY THE LIBERTY OF A MAN, A HUMAN BEING, AND HERE HE IS, O.J. SIMPSON.IN TERMS OF THE LACK OF FOUNDATION FOR THE PHYSICAL CAPABILITY OF THE DEFENDANT, THAT WILL BE PRESENTED IN THE COURSE OF TESTIMONY. OBVIOUSLY THE OPENING STATEMENT DOESN'T PRESENT ALL OF THE EVIDENCE. IT IS A PREVIEW OF WHAT IS TO COME, AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE EVIDENCE THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO PREVIEW FOR THE JURY.WHEN IT IS PRESENTED IN THE COURSE OF TRIAL THERE WILL BE FOUNDATIONAL TESTIMONY FROM MR. SIMPSON'S PHYSICIAN AS TO HIS PHYSICAL CAPABILITY TO CORROBORATE THE PHYSICAL DEMONSTRATION.

THE SCENES THAT WERE SHOWN IN THE TAPE THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN OVER TO THE PEOPLE ARE NOT SCENES THAT WERE TAKEN FROM CNN, BUT RATHER THEY ARE A COLLECTION OF DIFFERENT TAPES THAT WERE RECEIVED FROM DIFFERENT LOCAL NEWS MEDIA, SO THAT FOR US TO INTRODUCE THESE DIFFERENT SNIPPETS, IF YOU WILL, AT TRIAL, WE SIMPLY BE ABLE TO LAY THE FOUNDATION BY SUBPOENAING AND BRINGING IN TO TESTIFY THOSE OPERATORS OF I THINK IT IS LOCAL CHANNELS, 5, 7, 11 AND 13 FROM WHOM THESE PARTICULAR SNIPPETS WERE CULLED.THAT TAPE HAS NOW BEEN PROVIDED TO THE COURT AND THAT TAPE HAS ALSO BEEN PROVIDED TO THE PEOPLE. WE NOW HAVE THE TAPE FROM SAN FRANCISCO THAT HAD TWO OTHER BLIPS THAT WERE NOT SHOWN ON THE FIRST TAPE.I AM TOLD BY MR. HODGMAN THAT THE PEOPLE WOULD CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THEIR OBJECTION, SO WHAT I WOULD PROPOSE, YOUR HONOR, IS THAT THE COURT ALLOW THE SHOWING OF THE SCENES THAT WERE DISPLAYED YESTERDAY. THEY ARE SCENES, YOUR HONOR, THAT ARE VERY CAPABLE OF BEING AUTHENTICATED. IN MANY WAYS IT IS SELF-AUTHENTICATING. IN MANY WAYS THEY ARE AUTHENTICATED BECAUSE THERE WILL BE AN EVIDENCE OR A POLICE LOG WHERE EACH INDIVIDUAL WHO COMES ON TO THE SCENE FIRST CHECKS IN WITH ONE OF THE POLICE OFFICERS THAT ARE THERE. THAT LOG WILL BE AN ITEM OF EVIDENCE.AND IT IS POSSIBLE BY SHOWING THE SCENES AND HAVING THOSE DEPICTED THERE, TESTIFY TO ESTABLISH CLEARLY WHEN THE VARIOUS PIECES OF SCENES WERE TAKEN AND WHAT SORTS OF THINGS WERE OCCURRING.IT IS TRUE, YOUR HONOR, THAT IT IS THE PEOPLE'S CRIME SCENE. IT IS TRUE, YOUR HONOR, THAT THEY THEMSELVES DO NOT HAVE A VIDEOTAPE OF THE CRIME SCENE. THERE ARE CERTAIN DISCREET ACTS THAT ARE GOING ON, FOR EXAMPLE, DETECTIVE LANGE MEASURING A CERTAIN LOCATION. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU SEE CRIMINALIST FUNG PLACING DOWN PARTICULAR EVIDENCE TAGS.YOU WILL SEE, ALTHOUGH YOU WILL SEE DETECTIVES WALKING THROUGH -- DETECTIVE VANNATTER AND ROGERS WALKING THROUGH, AND QUITE CLEARLY THE SHEET IS THERE BECAUSE THE BODY HAS BEEN REMOVED, BUT THE SHEET REMAINS, AND IT SHOWS, YOUR HONOR, THE SORT OF SENSE THAT WE ARE GOING TO DEPICT IN WORDS. IT HELPS TO PROVIDE A VISUAL CONTEXT TO THE WORDS THAT MR. COCHRAN IS GOING TO SPEAK.HE IS GOING TO DISCUSS HOW THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THERE WAS CONTAMINATION OF THE CRIME SCENE. WE WOULD THEN HOPE TO SHOW PICTURES THAT DEMONSTRATE, THAT REFLECT THE CONTAMINATION OF THE CRIME SCENE.THEY ARE GOING TO OFFER EVIDENCE, I SUPPOSE, YOUR HONOR, HOW THE CRIME SCENE WAS NOT CONTAMINATED. PERHAPS THEY WILL SHOW THAT WHEN THESE SCENES WERE SHOWN ALL OF THE ITEMS OF EVIDENCE HAD BEEN COLLECTED. PERHAPS THEY WILL SHOW OR THEY WILL OFFER EVIDENCE THAT WHEN THESE SCENES WERE SHOWN IT WAS THE NEXT DAY OR THE THIRD DAY AFTER.THAT IS THE RISK THAT WE ARE GOING TO TAKE BY THE STATEMENTS THAT WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IN OUR OPENING STATEMENT, BUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE THE VISUAL REFLECTIONS OF CERTAIN WORDS, MR. COCHRAN I THINK QUITE PROPERLY WILL BE ABLE TO DISCUSS AND TO SPEAK ABOUT HOW THE CRIME SCENE WAS CONTAMINATED AND HOW WE CONTEND THESE SCENES ARE SIMPLY A SMALL REFLECTION FROM THE ONLY LIVE RECORD THAT IS AVAILABLE SHOWING THE CONDUCT OF DETECTIVES VANNATTER AND OTHER DETECTIVES AT BOTH THE ROCKINGHAM AND BUNDY CRIME SCENES ON JUNE THE 13TH.YOUR HONOR, THAT I THINK IS THE END OF MY OBJECTIONS TO THE CHARTS THAT THE -- THAT THE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO OFFER AND MY EXPLANATION TO THE ITEMS THAT WERE REMAINING YESTERDAY.

IT HAD NOT YET BEEN DONE. THESE ARE NAVY BLUE TO BLACK SOCKS WHICH IF YOU LOOK AT IT WITH THE NAKED EYE YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SEE ANYTHING.IT WAS SCHEDULED FOR A BLOOD SEARCH AND IT WAS PUT DOWN THAT NONE WAS OBVIOUS BECAUSE ON A BLACK PAIR OF SOCKS YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SEE BLOOD. AT BEST YOU MIGHT SEE SOMETHING WET, BUT BEFORE A PERIOD OF TIME, AND WHEN IT DRIES YOU WON'T EVEN SEE THAT, SO IT WAS SCHEDULED FOR A BLOOD SEARCH.AND WHAT MR. DOUGLAS HAS ON THIS CHART IS VERY MISLEADING BECAUSE IT INDICATES THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY LOOKED FOR BLOOD AND THAT NONE IS OBVIOUS. THIS IS EXACTLY THE PROBLEM. AND IF MR. DOUGLAS HAD SPOKEN TO MR.

#MS. CLARK: ,"-- AGAIN, THE SAME FOUNDATIONAL PROBLEMS WE HAVE WITH RESPECT TO TIME. WE DON'T HAVE THE AUTHENTICATION IN TERMS OF THE TIMING AND THAT IS CRITICAL IN TERMS OF THE EVIDENCE COLLECTION.THE INFERENCE THAT THE DEFENSE WILL SEEK TO DRAW IS THAT ALL OF THE EVIDENCE COLLECTED BY LAPD WAS CONTAMINATED IN SOME MANNER BY THE METHOD -- BY THE ACTIONS THAT ARE SHOWN ON THE TAPE.IF THE EVIDENCE WAS ALREADY COLLECTED BY THE TIME THESE PEOPLE ARE SHOWN IN THE POSITIONS SHOWN IN THE VIDEO, THEN THERE IS IN FACT NO IMPACT AND THE INFERENCE THAT THEY ARE SEEKING TO DRAW IS DIRECTLY MISLEADING TO THE JURY AND THAT IS ONE THING THAT IN OPENING STATEMENT NEITHER SIDE IS PERMITTED TO DO.THE PEOPLE ARE NOT ATTEMPTING TO TELL THE DEFENSE HOW TO TRY THEIR CASE. THE PEOPLE ARE ASKING THIS COURT ONLY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE JURY IS NOT MISLED SO THAT THEY GET THE TRUTH, SO THAT THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE EVIDENCE REALLY IS, NOT SPIN AND NOT DISTORTION AND NOT HALF TRUTHS OR STATEMENTS TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT, BUT THE TRUTH.AND THE PROBLEM WITH A VIDEO SUCH AS THIS ONE IS THAT WE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING WHEN IT WAS SHOT. AND THE INFERENCE THAT THE DEFENSE SEEKS TO DRAW FROM IT MAY BE COMPLETELY FALSE, IN WHICH CASE THE JURY BEGINS THE CASE WITH A TOTAL MISCONCEPTION ABOUT THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE EVIDENCE WAS COLLECTED.AND THAT IS A VERY DAMAGING THING AND THAT IS WHY THE DEFENSE OF COURSE SEEKS TO DO IT, I UNDERSTAND, BUT IT IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE THING TO DO.THE JURY DESERVES TO GET THE TRUTH AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THE EVIDENCE REALLY IS.

#THE COURT: ,"ALL RIGHT. DO YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THE OTHER ISSUES, THE SOCK CHART AND THE CONDUCT CHART?
","JANUARY 24, 1995 ",9:09 A.M.
#MS. CLARK: ,"YES. I THINK THE SOCK CHART I HAVE, YOUR HONOR. I HAVE ADDRESSED THAT. THAT IS AGAIN TOTALLY MISLEADING WITH RESPECT TO BLOOD SEARCH.WITH RESPECT TO THE CHART NOW, THE NEW ONE IS EVEN WORSE THAN THE OTHER. FIRST OF ALL, IT REPEATS THE MISLEADING AND COMPLETELY FALSE INFERENCE DRAWN ABOUT THE BLOOD SEARCH. THEY SEEK TO ARGUE IN DEROGATION OF REALITY, IN DEROGATION OF THE TRUTH.THE TRUTH IS THAT IT WAS SCHEDULED FOR A BLOOD SEARCH. WHAT THEY SEEK TO INFER FROM THIS IS THAT IT WAS ALREADY CONDUCTED AND NONE WAS OBVIOUS, AND THAT IS EXACTLY A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DEGREES OPPOSITE OF THE TRUTH, SO THAT IS A COMPLETE FALSEHOOD.WITH RESPECT TO MARK FUHRMAN AND THE GLOVES, AGAIN IT IS FALSE. THEY STATE -- THEY PUT ON THE PLURAL WHICH WAS NEVER STATED BY MARK FUHRMAN. THEY TAKE HIS STATEMENT OUT OF CONTEXT.THERE IS AN EXTENSIVE COLLOQUY BETWEEN HIMSELF AND COUNSEL IN WHICH HE REFERS TO ONE GLOVE THAT HE SAW AT THE FOOT OF RON GOLDMAN AND HE SAYS THAT REPEATEDLY, AND YET TAKING ONE STATEMENT OUT OF CONTEXT THEY SEEK TO DRAW INFERENCES FROM IT.IT IS ARGUMENTATIVE, IT IS NOT AN OPENING STATEMENT AND IT IS MISLEADING AND UNFAIR BECAUSE IT IS TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT.THE SAME WOULD GO FOR RON PHILLIPS TO THE CORONER. OF COURSE THESE ARE TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT. HOW COULD COUNSEL ARGUE TO THE CONTRARY WHEN YOU HAVE A LENGTHY TRANSCRIPT OF STATEMENTS THAT HAVE EXPLANATORY INFORMATION BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER. YOU HAVE A AND C AND YOU TAKE OUT B AND THAT IS WHAT COUNSEL HAS DONE, TAKEN IT OUT OF PROPER CONTEXT AND STUCK IT ON A CHART, AND AGAIN IT IS ARGUMENTATIVE.WITH RESPECT TO THE VANNATTER WARRANT, THAT STATEMENT IS IRRELEVANT. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT LANGUAGE IN A SEARCH WARRANT THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE COURT TO RULE ON. THAT IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR A JURY TO BE PRESENTED. THE JURY HAS TO BE THE TRIER OF FACT TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE DEFENDANT IS GUILTY OR INNOCENT, NOT WHETHER THE SEARCH WAS PROPER OR IMPROPER. THAT IS A LEGAL ARGUMENT THAT GOES TO THE COURT; NOT TO THE JURY.THAT STATEMENT IS INAPPROPRIATE AND IT IS ARGUMENTATIVE AS WELL.WITH RESPECT TO PRESERVING THE CRIME SCENE EVIDENCE, THE DEFENSE -- IF THEY ARE SAYING THE TRAINEE IS ANDREA MAZZOLLA, ANDREA MAZZOLLA WAS NOT IN CHARGE. SHE WAS A TRAINEE WHO WAS BEING SUPERVISED BY DENNIS FUNG, SO THIS IS FALSE. THIS IS A FALSE STATEMENT. IF THAT IS WHO THEY ARE CLAIMING WAS IN CHARGE OF THE CRIME SCENE, THAT IS UNTRUE AND MISLEADING.I THOUGHT THAT THE COURT'S RULING PERTAINING TO MARK FUHRMAN WAS THAT NEITHER SIDE COULD MENTION HIM. THAT WAS JUST KATHLEEN BELL?

SHE SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING.WITH REGARD TO THE SOCKS, WE WILL ACCEPT WHATEVER YOUR HONOR SAYS ABOUT THAT. AGAIN, IF YOU LOOK AT THIS PARTICULAR FORM, YOUR HONOR, THIS FORM IS ENTITLED ""O.J. SIMPSON SUMMARY OF ANALYZED EVIDENCE BY ANALYSIS PERFORMED."" WE ARE USING THEIR OWN FORM. THEIR OWN FORM, YOUR HONOR, BY ANALYSIS PERFORMED, AND IT SAYS UNDER THERE ""NONE OBVIOUS"" AND SO WE TOOK THEIR OWN FORM.AND SO, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A RECENT MOVIE, YOUR HONOR, THERE IS A LINE WHICH I THINK IS VERY APPROPRIATE IN THIS CASE -- I THINK IT WAS A FEW GOOD MEN -- WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT THE TRUTH.

IT CERTAINLY HAS BEEN ON THE MINDS OF MY PEOPLE UP IN RICHMOND, CALIFORNIA AND FRIENDS IN FAYETTEVILLE, GEORGIA AND ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY.EVERYBODY WANTS TO KNOW AND EVERYBODY I KNOW OFTEN POSE A QUESTION TO ME, DID O.J. SIMPSON REALLY KILL NICOLE BROWN AND RONALD GOLDMAN.WELL, FINALLY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I AM HERE IN FRONT OF YOU THIS MORNING TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. AND WE'LL ANSWER THAT QUESTION FROM THE WITNESS STAND AND FROM THE EXHIBITS YOU'LL SEE IN THIS CASE AND FROM THE EVIDENCE.AND WHEN YOU SEE THE EVIDENCE AND WHEN YOU HEAR THE WITNESSES AND WHEN YOU PUT IT ALL TOGETHER AND CONSIDER THE TOTALITY OF CIRCUMSTANCES IN THIS CASE, THE ANSWER WILL BE CLEAR TO YOU AS WELL.THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION IS YES. THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION IS YES, O.J. SIMPSON MURDERED NICOLE BROWN AND RONALD GOLDMAN. AND I'M SURE YOU WILL BE WONDERING WHY AS THE TRIAL PROCEEDS ON AND I'M SURE YOU ARE WONDERING WHY RIGHT NOW.AS THE JUDGE INSTRUCTED YOU ALREADY, OPENING STATEMENTS ARE NOT EVIDENCE. OPENING STATEMENTS ARE GIVEN BY LAWYERS. AND IN AN OPENING STATEMENT, WE INFORM THE JURY OF WHAT WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW IN THIS CASE, WHAT WE BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW.BUT WE'RE LAWYERS. WE'RE NOT WITNESSES. WE'RE NOT UNDER OATH. NOTHING WE SAY IS EVIDENCE. THE THINGS WE SAY TO YOU TODAY ARE NOT THE THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD CARRY INTO THE JURY ROOM AND INTO DELIBERATIONS.YOU SHOULD CARRY INTO THE JURY ROOM AND INTO YOUR DELIBERATIONS THE EVIDENCE IN THE CASE, THE TESTIMONY FROM THE WITNESS STAND, THE EXHIBITS ADMITTED AT TRIAL, THE INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN TO YOU BY THE COURT. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THAT, WHEN YOU GO BACK AND REFLECT ON THE TESTIMONY AND THE EXHIBITS AND EVERYTHING YOU HEARD AND SAW IN THIS CASE, YOU WILL KNOW WHY HE KILLED NICOLE BROWN AND RONALD GOLDMAN.AND WHEN I GIVE YOU THE ANSWER, AS I HAVE, YOU STOP AND CONSIDER AND THINK WHY WOULD HE DO IT, WHY WOULD HE DO IT, NOT O.J. SIMPSON, NOT THE O.J. SIMPSON WE THINK WE KNOW, NOT THE O.J. SIMPSON WE'VE SEEN OVER THE YEARS. BUT THAT IS ANOTHER QUESTION, AND THAT QUESTION IS, DO YOU KNOW O.J. SIMPSON.WE'VE SEEN HIM PLAY FOOTBALL FOR USC. WE WATCHED HIM THRASH UCLA PLAYING THE ROSE BOWL. WE WATCHED HIM WIN THE HEISMAN TROPHY. HE MAY BE THE BEST RUNNING BACK IN THE HISTORY OF THE NFL.WE WATCHED HIM LEAP TURNSTILES AND CHAIRS AND RUN TO AIRPLANES IN THE HERTZ COMMERCIALS AND WE WATCHED HIM WITH A 15-INCH AFRO IN NAKED GUN 33-1/2 AND WE'VE SEEN HIM TIME AND TIME AGAIN AND WE CAME TO THINK THAT WE KNOW HIM.WHAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IS THE PUBLIC FACE, THE PUBLIC PERSONA, THE FACE OF THE ATHLETE, THE FACE OF THE ACTOR.IT IS NOT THE ACTOR WHO IS ON TRIAL HERE TODAY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. IT IS NOT THAT PUBLIC FACE. IT IS HIS OTHER FACE LIKE MANY MEN IN PUBLIC. LIKE MANY PUBLIC MEN, THEY HAVE A PUBLIC IMAGE, A PUBLIC PERSONA, A PUBLIC SIDE, A PUBLIC LIFE AND THEY ALSO HAVE A PRIVATE SIDE, A PRIVATE LIFE, A PRIVATE FACE. AND THAT IS THE FACE WE WILL EXPOSE TO YOU IN THIS TRIAL, THE OTHER SIDE OF O.J. SIMPSON, THE SIDE YOU NEVER MET BEFORE.WE WILL EXPOSE IN THIS TRIAL AND SHOW TO YOU IN THIS TRIAL THAT OTHER FACE, THE FACE HE WORE BEHIND THE LOCKS AND THE GATES AND THE WALL AT ROCKINGHAM, THAT OTHER FACE, THE ONE THAT NICOLE BROWN ENCOUNTERED ALMOST EVERY DAY OF HER ADULT LIFE, THE ONE SHE ENCOUNTERED DURING THE LAST MOMENTS OF HER ADULT LIFE; THE SAME FACE RONALD GOLDMAN ENCOUNTERED DURING THE LAST MOMENTS OF HIS LIFE.WHEN WE LOOK UPON AND LOOK BEHIND THAT PUBLIC FACE, THE PUBLIC FACE OF THE MAN WHO SITS HERE IN COURT TODAY, YOU'LL SEE A DIFFERENT FACE. AND THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THE FACE YOU WILL SEE AND THE MAN THAT YOU WILL SEE WILL BE THE FACE OF A BATTERER, A WIFE BEATER, AN ABUSER, A CONTROLLER. YOU'LL SEE THE FACE OF RON -- OF RON'S AND NICOLE'S MURDERER.TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED AT BUNDY, WE NEED TO EXAMINE THIS DEFENDANT'S RELATIONSHIP WITH NICOLE. BECAUSE WHEN WE DO, WE CAN DISCERN FROM THAT, WE CAN SEE A MOTIVE, WE CAN SEE HIS MOTIVE FOR KILLING HIS EX-WIFE.AND I SUBMIT TO YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THAT AS THE TRIAL PROCEEDS ON AND AS YOU HEAR THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE, THAT MOTIVE WILL BECOME CLEAR.HE KILLED NICOLE FOR A SINGLE REASON. NOT BECAUSE HE HATED HER. HE DIDN'T HATE NICOLE. HE DIDN'T KILL HER BECAUSE HE DIDN'T LOVE HER ANYMORE, BECAUSE IN HIS MIND, IN HIS MIND, HE DID.HE KILLED HER FOR A REASON ALMOST AS OLD AS MANKIND ITSELF. HE KILLED HER OUT OF JEALOUSY. HE KILLED HER BECAUSE HE COULDN'T HAVE HER; AND IF HE COULDN'T HAVE HER, HE DIDN'T WANT ANYBODY ELSE TO HAVE HER.HE KILLED HER TO CONTROL HER. CONTROL IS A CONTINUING THING. IT WAS A CONTINUING THING, THE CENTRAL FOCUS OF THEIR ENTIRE RELATIONSHIP.BY KILLING NICOLE, THIS DEFENDANT ASSUMED TOTAL CONTROL OVER HER. BY KILLING HER, HE COMMITTED THE ULTIMATE ACT OF CONTROL. BY KILLING HER, NO ONE ELSE COULD HAVE HER, NO ONE BUT HIM.AND HE KILLED RON GOLDMAN. AND HE KILLED RON GOLDMAN FOR ANOTHER REASON. HE KILLED RON GOLDMAN BECAUSE HE GOT IN THE WAY.HE KILLED NICOLE BECAUSE HE HAD A PROBLEM WITH HER AS MEN AND WOMEN SOMETIMES DO HAVE IN A RELATIONSHIP. THEY HAVE A PROBLEM.AND THIS DEFENDANT'S PROBLEM, THE MAN IN THE COURTROOM -- I THINK HE STATED HIS PROBLEM RATHER ELOQUENTLY AT HER WAKE AS HE STOOD OVER HER BODY AT HER WAKE, AND HE SAID THEN AND HE SAID ON OTHER OCCASIONS, AND I QUOTE, HE SAID WHILE STANDING OVER THAT CASKET, WHILE STANDING OVER NICOLE'S BODY, ""MY PROBLEM WAS THAT I LOVED YOU TOO MUCH.""BUT IT WASN'T REALLY LOVE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AND THIS WILL BE REFLECTED IN THE EVIDENCE AND THE EVIDENCE WILL ESTABLISH THIS, THAT IT WASN'T REALLY LOVE.WHAT THIS DEFENDANT HAD FOR NICOLE BROWN WASN'T LOVE. IT WAS OBSESSION. HE BECAME OBSESSED WITH HER, AND HIS OBSESSION WAS SO GREAT THAT HE DEVELOPED A NEED TO CONTROL HER. AND HIS NEED TO CONTROL AND HIS FEELINGS OF OBSESSION AND HIS OBSESSION WAS SO GREAT THAT WHEN HE CAME TO REALIZE THAT HE COULD NOT KEEP HER, HE KILLED HER BECAUSE TO LET HER GO WOULD MEAN TO LOSE CONTROL OF HER. TO LET HER GO WITH RON GOLDMAN OR SOMEONE ELSE WOULD MEAN TO LOSE CONTROL. HE COULDN'T HAVE HER AND NEITHER COULD ANYONE ELSE.NOW, THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE WILL ESTABLISH THAT THE MAN IN THE COURTROOM, THIS DEFENDANT IS AN EXTREMELY CONTROLLING AND POSSESSIVE MAN. AND AS I SAID BEFORE, CONTROL AND POSSESSIVENESS WAS A SINGLE DOMINANT THING THROUGHOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP.AND HE CONTROLLED HER IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. HE CONTROLLED HER FINANCIALLY.AND WHEN THE DEFENDANT AND NICOLE FIRST MET, SHE WAS BARELY 18 YEARS OLD. HE WAS ALMOST 30. SHE SHARED AN APARTMENT. HE OWNED A MANSION. SHE WAITED TABLES AT A RESTAURANT. HE WAS A MILLIONAIRE. NO ONE HAD EVER HEARD OF NICOLE BROWN, BUT HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST RECOGNIZED MEN IN AMERICA.BUT AFTER HE MET HER, HE SLOWLY BEGAN TO CONTROL HER. SHE SHARED AN APARTMENT WITH A FRIEND. HE GOT HER HER OWN APARTMENT. HE BOUGHT HER THINGS. HE GAVE HER THINGS. BY THE TIME SHE WAS 19, SHE WAS DRIVING A PORSCHE. HE GOT IT FOR HER.HE BEGAN TO GAIN CONTROL OVER HER. AND THROUGHOUT THE YEARS, THROUGHOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP, HE MAINTAINED THAT ECONOMIC CONTROL OVER HER, THAT FINANCIAL CONTROL.THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT NICOLE NEVER REALLY HELD A JOB. SHE NEVER REALLY WORKED. SHE NEVER REALLY OPERATED A BUSINESS. SHE NEVER HAD AN INCOME REALLY OF HER OWN.THROUGHOUT HER ENTIRE ADULT LIFE, THIS MAN, DEFENDANT IN THE COURTROOM, HELD HER PURSE STRINGS IN HER LIFE. WHATEVER MONEY SHE GOT, WHATEVER MATERIAL POSSESSIONS SHE GOT, SHE GOT FROM THE DEFENDANT.PEOPLE CAN SOMETIMES BE BOUGHT. AND YOUNG PEOPLE SOMETIMES CAN BE EASILY MISLED. NICOLE WAS A VERY YOUNG WOMAN IF A WOMAN AT ALL WHEN SHE FIRST MET THIS DEFENDANT, THE MAN SEATED IN THE COURTROOM. AND AS THE YEARS WENT ON AND AS THEY CONTINUED TO DATE AND AS HE GAINED MORE AND MORE CONTROL OVER HER, THE MORE CONTROL HE GAINED, THE MORE ABUSIVE HE BECAME.AS YOU LISTEN TO THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE, YOU'RE GOING TO BE HEARING EVIDENCE REGARDING DOMESTIC ABUSE, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, STALKING, INTIMIDATION, PHYSICAL ABUSE, WIFE BEATING, PUBLIC HUMILIATION. AS YOU LISTEN TO THE TRIAL AND AS YOU HEAR THIS EVIDENCE AND SEE THIS EVIDENCE, PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT KINDS OF ABUSE WERE ALL DIFFERENT METHODS TO CONTROL HER.LET ME PROCEED ON.THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW IN THIS CASE THAT HE ABUSED HER MENTALLY. HE STRIPPED HER OF HER SELF ESTEEM.THIS DEFENDANT DICTATED THE WAY NICOLE WOULD DRESS. HE DICTATED THE WAY SHE WOULD WEAR HER HAIR. AND WHEN HE DIDN'T LIKE HER APPEARANCE, HE WOULD CRITICIZE HER, HE WOULD HUMILIATE HER TO THE POINT WHERE SHE WOULD CRY. IF HE DIDN'T LIKE HER SHOES, HE WOULD GO OUT AND BUY SHOES. ""THIS IS WHAT I WANT YOU TO WEAR. WEAR THIS. LOOK LIKE THIS.""SHE WAS NOT A BARBIE DOLL, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT HE WAS SO CONTROLLING THAT HE ATTEMPTED TO DEFINE HER IDENTITY. HE ATTEMPTED TO DEFINE WHO SHE WAS.WHEN SHE WAS PREGNANT AND PUT ON WEIGHT, THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THIS DEFENDANT WAS SO ABUSIVE THAT HE CALLED HER NAMES. HE CALLED HER FAT. HE CALLED HER A PIG. AND HE DID THIS IN THE PRESENCE OF HER FAMILY AND IN THE PRESENCE OF HER FRIENDS AND HE HUMILIATED HER.THAT IS THE FACE WE INTEND TO EXPOSE IN THIS TRIAL. THAT'S THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS DEFENDANT WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU IN THIS TRIAL.AND BY DOING THESE THINGS AND BY HURTLING THESE INSULTS, HE STRIPPED HER OF HER SELF ESTEEM.AND WHEN YOU'RE CONTROLLING SOMEONE FINANCIALLY AND WHEN THEY HAVE NO SELF ESTEEM AND WHEN THEY HAVE NO IDENTITY, YOU HAVE THEM, YOU CONTROL THEM.THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THIS DEFENDANT, THIS MAN IN THE COURTROOM WAS A VERY CONTROLLING AND POSSESSIVE MAN AND THAT THE DOMINANT THING THROUGHOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP WAS HIS CONTROL OF NICOLE BROWN.BUT HE DID MORE. HE DID MORE THAN JUST DEMEAN HER IN THE PRESENCE OF OTHERS. HE ATTEMPTED TO ISOLATE HER SOMETIMES FROM SOME PEOPLE.WHEN CERTAIN MEN CAME AROUND, HE BECAME JEALOUS AND HE BECAME SO JEALOUS THAT HE GOT TO THE POINT WHERE SHE WOULD NOT AGREE OR WANT TO BE AROUND CERTAIN MEN BECAUSE SHE WAS CONCERNED THAT HE MIGHT GET JEALOUS BY THEIR MERE PRESENCE.AND AS TIME WENT ON AND AS HE BECAME JEALOUS AND MORE AND MORE JEALOUS, HE EVEN INSISTED THAT SHE NOT BE AROUND CERTAIN MEN.HE BEGAN TO ISOLATE HER, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WHEN HER FRIENDS CAME AROUND, HER GIRLFRIENDS CAME AROUND AND WHEN HE FELT THAT SHE WAS SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME WITH THOSE GIRLFRIENDS, HE TALKED TO THE GIRLFRIENDS. HE LET THEM KNOW. HE DIDN'T LIKE THEM HANGING AROUND. HE DISSUADED HER GIRLFRIENDS FROM HANGING AROUND.HE ATTEMPTED TO ISOLATE HER FROM OTHER PEOPLE.AND WHEN YOU ISOLATE SOMEONE AND WHEN YOU HAVE ECONOMIC CONTROL OVER SOMEONE AND WHEN YOU STRIP SOMEONE OF THEIR SELF ESTEEM AND WHEN YOU ESTABLISH THEIR IDENTITY, YOU HAVE THEM. THEY'RE YOURS. YOU CAN CONTROL THEM.AND THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW IN THIS CASE THAT THIS MAN IS AN EXTREMELY POSSESSIVE AND CONTROLLING INDIVIDUAL AND THAT HE IS AN EXTREMELY POSSESSIVE INDIVIDUAL WHEN IT CAME TO NICOLE, AND HIS OBSESSION WAS MANIFESTED BY THE THINGS HE DID TOWARD CONTROLLING HER.BY DEMEANING HER AND CONTROLLING THE PURSE STRINGS AND ISOLATING HER AND DEFINING WHO SHE WOULD SEE AND WHO SHE WOULDN'T SEE AND WHO HER FRIENDS WOULD BE AND WHO THEY WOULD NOT BE WASN'T ALL THIS DEFENDANT DID TO CONTROL THIS WOMAN.THERE ARE MORE POWERFUL FORMS OF CONTROL. THERE'S FORCE, THERE'S VIOLENCE, THERE'S FEAR, THERE'S INTIMIDATION.AND YOU WILL HEAR TESTIMONY, YOU WILL SEE EVIDENCE THAT IN HIS QUEST TO CONTROL NICOLE, THIS DEFENDANT USED ALL THESE THINGS. HE USED FEAR, HE USED INTIMIDATION AND HE USED VIOLENCE.AND HE INSTILLED SUCH A FEAR IN HER, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU'LL HEAR TESTIMONY THAT HE COULD WALK INTO A ROOM -- HE WOULD WALK INTO A ROOM, AND NICOLE WOULD BE THERE, AND A MOMENT BEFORE HE WALKED IN, SHE WOULD JUST BE THE MOST CHARMING INDIVIDUAL THAT THERE IS, RELAXED; BUT WHEN HE WALKED IN, HER DEMEANOR CHANGED COMPLETELY. AS TIME WENT ON, HIS MERE PRESENCE BECAME INTIMIDATING TO HER.I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT THEY MET WHEN SHE WAS AROUND 18 YEARS OLD BACK IN 1977, AND THEY DATED FOR EIGHT YEARS AND THEY EVENTUALLY MARRIED IN 1985. AND THE MARRIAGE WAS A STORMY MARRIAGE AND IT WAS A MARRIAGE PUNCTUATED BY ACTS OF VIOLENCE.AND THAT VIOLENCE WOULD ALWAYS BE FOLLOWED BY AN APOLOGY. HE WOULD APOLOGIZE, GIVE HER JEWELRY, BUY HER FLOWERS.HE WOULD PROMISE TO DO BETTER, PROMISE, PROMISE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF HIMSELF AND HE WOULD PROMISE NOT TO DO IT AGAIN. AND THEN THOSE ACTS OF VIOLENCE WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY ADDITIONAL ACTS OF VIOLENCE, AND IT BECAME A CYCLE; VIOLENCE, APOLOGIES, A PERIOD OF QUIET AND CALM, THEN VIOLENCE AND APOLOGIES, QUIET AND CALM, VIOLENCE, APOLOGIES, QUIET, CALM.A CYCLE OF VIOLENCE CHARACTERIZED THEIR RELATIONSHIP. IT CHARACTERIZED THEIR MARRIAGE.AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THAT'S -- THAT'S A DIFFICULT TOPIC BECAUSE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS BEHIND THE GATES AND THE WALLS. IT HAPPENS IN THE BEDROOM AND INSIDE THE HOME AND PLACES WHERE THE PUBLIC CAN'T SEE.DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS A PRIVATE AFFAIR GENERALLY WHILE IT'S OCCURRING, AND SO IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN EVIDENCE, TO GAIN PROOF THAT THE VIOLENCE OCCURRED AND IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN EVIDENCE AND GAIN PROOF THAT THE RELATIONSHIP IS A VIOLENT RELATIONSHIP.BUT WE DO HAVE THAT PROOF. WE DO HAVE PROOF. WE DO HAVE EVIDENCE. YOU WILL HEAR TESTIMONY FROM WITNESSES IN THIS CASE, AND THEY WILL DISCUSS THE VIOLENT RELATIONSHIP, THE VIOLENT MARRIAGE THIS DEFENDANT HAD WITH NICOLE BROWN.IN 1985, THE POLICE RESPONDED TO THE DEFENDANT'S HOME ON ROCKINGHAM IN RESPONSE TO A CALL. AND WHEN THEY ARRIVED, THEY WERE MET BY NICOLE. SHE WAS CRYING, SHE WAS UPSET AND HER FACE WAS PUFFY AND SHE WAS NEAR HYSTERICS.SHE TOLD THESE PEOPLE, SHE SAID, ""WE HAD A FIGHT. AFTER THE FIGHT, I WAS TRYING TO LEAVE. AND WHEN I TRIED TO LEAVE, THE DEFENDANT GRABBED A BASEBALL BAT, AND HE TOOK THAT BASEBALL BAT AND HE SMASHED THE WINDSHIELD TO MY CAR."" THIS IS 1985.AND AS THEY LOOKED AROUND, THESE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS, THEY LOOKED TO THE RIGHT AND THEY SAW A WHITE 450SL MERCEDES BENZ, AND THE WINDSHIELD WAS SMASHED OUT.JUST THEN, THE DEFENDANT CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE AND HE OFFERED AN EXPLANATION. WELL, THE POLICE DIDN'T ARREST HIM. THEY LEFT. THEY LEFT NICOLE THERE. THEY LEFT THE DEFENDANT THERE.AND THAT ISN'T AN ACT OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE TOWARD NICOLE, IS IT, OR IS IT? MAYBE IT IS.NICOLE BROWN WAS THERE TO WITNESS THIS ACT, THIS VIOLENCE ON HER VEHICLE.AND IF YOU'RE MARRIED TO SOMEONE AND YOU LOVE SOMEONE AND YOU HAVE A FIGHT WITH THEM AND THEY TAKE A BASEBALL BAT AND THEY DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO ONE OF YOUR PRIZED POSSESSIONS, COULD IT BE, COULD IT BE THAT THEY ARE SENDING A MESSAGE?THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THIS WAS A MESSAGE. IT WAS AN INDICATION, IT WAS A WARNING AS TO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT. IT WAS A WARNING THAT WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS MERCEDES BENZ COULD JUST AS WELL HAPPEN TO YOU. AND IT DID HAPPEN TO NICOLE. NOT WITH THE BASEBALL BAT; BUT JUST LIKE THAT MERCEDES GOT SMASHED AND DENTED, SO DID NICOLE.YOU WILL BE HEARING EVIDENCE, YOU WILL BE HEARING TESTIMONY, YOU WILL BE SEEING WITNESSES IN THIS CASE REGARDING AN INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED ON JANUARY 1, 1989.IT WAS ALMOST 4:00 O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING ON JANUARY 1ST WHEN THE 911 OPERATOR RECEIVED A TELEPHONE CALL FROM ROCKINGHAM. AND THAT OPERATOR WILL BE HERE TO TESTIFY IN COURT AND THAT OPERATOR WILL BE HERE TO AUTHENTICATE THE TAPE OF THAT 911 CALL FROM ROCKINGHAM.AND WHEN THE OPERATOR APPEARS AND WHEN THE TAPE IS PLAYED, LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY, BECAUSE IF YOU LISTEN CAREFULLY, IN THE BACKGROUND, YOU WILL HEAR A WOMAN SCREAMING AND YOU WILL HEAR SOMETHING ELSE. YOU WILL HEAR THE SOUND OF THIS DEFENDANT, THIS MAN BEATING THIS WOMAN. YOU WILL HEAR THE SOUND OF HIS HAND SMACKING ACROSS HER FACE. YOU WILL HEAR THE SOUND OF THIS DEFENDANT BEATING HIS WIFE.WHEN THE POLICE ARRIVED, THEY ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM IN RESPONSE TO THAT TELEPHONE CALL. AND NICOLE NEVER GOT TO TELL THE 911 OPERATOR THAT, ""COME AND HELP ME,"" OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. ALL SHE DID WAS SCREAM.AND THE OPERATOR COULD HEAR HER SCREAMING AND THE OPERATOR COULD HEAR HER BEING BEATEN, AND SHE ADVISED LAPD UNITS TO RESPOND TO 360 NORTH ROCKINGHAM. ""WE CAN HEAR THE SOUND OF A WOMAN BEING BEATEN NOW, RIGHT NOW.""AND THE OFFICERS ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM A SHORT TIME LATER. AND WHEN THEY DID, THEY RANG THE BUZZER TO THE SECURITY GATE. AND AS THEY DID SO, THEY SAW SOMEONE RUN FROM THE BUSHES, RUN FROM THE DARKNESS IN THEIR DIRECTION.AND THE PERSON THAT THEY SAW WAS NICOLE. AND NICOLE CAME RUNNING OUT OF THE DARKNESS WEARING NOTHING BUT SWEAT PANTS AND A BRA RUNNING TOWARDS THE OFFICERS, AND SHE WAS COVERED WITH MUD AND SHE WAS DIRTY, SHE WAS FILTHY.AND SHE RAN TOWARDS THE OFFICERS. AND AS SHE RAN TOWARDS THE OFFICERS, SHE WAS SHOUTING AND YELLING, ""HE'S GOING TO KILL ME. HE'S GOING TO KILL ME.""AND THE OFFICERS STOOD THERE. THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.IT'S 4:00 O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING. SHE IS OUT THERE IN HER BRA AND SWEAT PANTS COVERED WITH MUD. THEY JUST GOT A CALL, THERE'S A WOMAN AT ROCKINGHAM BEING BEATEN NOW. SHE COMES RUNNING OUT OF THE DARKNESS OUT OF THE MUD AND OUT OF THE BUSHES, AND SHE PUSHES A BUTTON TO THE SECURITY GATE AND SHE RUNS THROUGH THE GATE AND SHE COLLAPSES IN THE ARMS OF THE OFFICER.THE ENTIRE TIME, SHE IS YELLING, ""HE'S GOING TO KILL ME. HE'S GOING TO KILL ME."" AND THE OFFICER SAID, ""WHO'S GOING TO KILL YOU?"" SHE SAID, ""O.J. IS GOING TO KILL ME.""AND THE OFFICERS LOOKED, THEY LOOKED AT NICOLE. HER EYE WAS SWOLLEN, BRUISED, HER LIP WAS CUT. ONE OF THE OFFICERS, THE SENIOR OFFICER THERE, HE LOOKED AT HER NECK; AND WHAT HE SAW STARTLED HIM. ON HER NECK, HE COULD SEE THE IMPRINT OF A HAND, THE IMPRINT OF A HAND AROUND HER NECK.IT WAS THEN THAT THE DEFENDANT CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE. HE WAS WEARING NOTHING BUT HIS BATHROBE. AND HE DID NOT ADDRESS HIS WIFE AT THE TIME AND HE DID NOT ASK THE POLICE HOW SHE WAS DOING OR IF SHE WAS OKAY.AND WHAT THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW AND WHAT YOU WILL HEAR IN THIS CASE IS THAT HE DEMEANED AND HUMILIATED HER EVEN MORE. HE SHOUTED TO THE OFFICERS IN THE PRESENCE OF NICOLE, HIS WIFE, ""I'VE GOT TWO WOMEN NOW. I DON'T NEED THAT ONE. I DON'T WANT THAT ONE IN MY BED ANYMORE.""THIS WAS HIS WIFE, AND THIS IS WHAT HE SAID TO THESE OFFICERS, THESE STRANGERS TO HIM. THIS IS WHAT HE SHOUTED OUT TO THE POLICE.THE OFFICERS WERE ON ONE SIDE OF THE GATE, OF THE WALL AND THE DEFENDANT AT THAT TIME WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE. AND THE OFFICERS SAID, ""MR. SIMPSON, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PLACE YOU UNDER ARREST. IT APPEARS THAT YOUR WIFE HAS BEEN BEATEN. SO PLEASE GO BACK INTO THE HOUSE AND PUT ON SOME CLOTHES AND COME WITH US. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOU TO THE STATION.""WELL, THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THAT DID NOT SIT WELL WITH THIS DEFENDANT, AND HE RESPONDED, ""THE POLICE HAVE BEEN HERE EIGHT TIMES BEFORE, AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO ARREST ME FOR THIS?"" EIGHT TIMES. THAT'S WHAT THE DEFENDANT SAID. THE POLICE HAD BEEN THERE EIGHT TIMES BEFORE?AND AS HE SAID, ""YOU'RE GOING TO ARREST ME FOR THIS,"" THE DEFENDANT TOLD THE OFFICERS, ""THIS IS A FAMILY MATTER.""THAT'S WHAT THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW. THE DEFENDANT SAID TO THE OFFICERS, ""THIS IS A FAMILY MATTER."" AND HE ASKED, ""WHY DO YOU WANT TO MAKE SUCH A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT? WE CAN HANDLE IT.""THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THE OFFICERS DID NOT LIKE THE WAY HE HAD HANDLED THINGS UP TO THAT POINT, AND THEY INSISTED THAT HE GET DRESSED AND THEY TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS UNDER ARREST AND THAT THEY WERE GOING TO TAKE HIM TO THE STATION.WELL, THIS WAS O.J. SIMPSON. AND HE DID GET DRESSED, BUT HE DIDN'T GO TO THE POLICE STATION. HE JUMPED IN HIS BENTLEY, HE SPED AWAY, THEY CHASED AFTER HIM, THEY DIDN'T CATCH HIM AND HE GOT AWAY. THE NEXT DAY, HE WENT TO THE ROSE BOWL.BUT DESPITE THIS, DESPITE '89, WHAT HAPPENED JANUARY 1, '89, DESPITE THE MERCEDES BENZ INCIDENT IN 1985, SHE STAYED. SHE STAYED WITH HIM.AND I'M NOT SUGGESTING AND THE EVIDENCE WON'T SUGGEST THAT EVERY DAY OF THEIR MARRIAGE OR THEIR RELATIONSHIP WAS STORMY, ROCKY AND FILLED WITH VIOLENCE. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING HERE.WHAT WE ARE SUGGESTING, AND THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW, THAT THERE WAS A CYCLE OF VIOLENCE, A CYCLE OF VIOLENCE; AND THE DOMINANT THEME IN THAT RELATIONSHIP AND IN THAT CYCLE AND THE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE WAS ALWAYS CONTROL, CONTROL.WELL, AFTER THE '89 INCIDENT, AFTER THAT NIGHT, THEIR RELATIONSHIP CHANGED SOMEWHAT. SHE WAS CONCERNED AND THE DEFENDANT WAS CONCERNED. THE DEFENDANT IS A PUBLIC MAN, AND HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT HIS PUBLIC IMAGE.AND IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN AND IN THE PUBLIC MEDIA BACK IN 1989, HE WAS INTERVIEWED BY ROY FIRESTONE ON ESPN. AND DURING THAT INTERVIEW, MR. FIRESTONE ASKED THE DEFENDANT ABOUT THAT INCIDENT ON THE MORNING OF JANUARY 1, AND THE DEFENDANT DOWNPLAYED IT. HE MINIMIZED THINGS, FLUFFED IT OVER. AND YOU'LL HEAR AND SEE THAT INTERVIEW.AND IN THAT INTERVIEW, THE DEFENDANT SAID IT WAS SORT OF A MUTUAL WRESTLING MATCH, SHE WAS WRONG, HE WAS WRONG, TA DA, NO BIG DEAL, AND THAT'S WHAT HE SAID TO THE PRESS AND TO THE PUBLIC. HE MINIMIZED THINGS.BUT YOU'LL HEAR TESTIMONY FROM INVESTIGATORS EMPLOYED WITH THE D.A.'S OFFICE AND THEY'LL TELL YOU ABOUT A DAY JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO WHEN THEY DRILLED A HOLE IN THE SAFE DEPOSIT BOX, NICOLE'S SAFE DEPOSIT BOX, AND THEY'LL TELL YOU ABOUT THE DAY THAT THEY RECOVERED PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN FROM NICOLE'S INCIDENT BACK IN '89 AND THEY'LL ALSO TELL YOU ABOUT THE RECOVERY OF SOME LETTERS THE DEFENDANT WROTE TO NICOLE AFTER THE 1989 BEATING.AND YOU'LL SEE THOSE LETTERS. THEY'LL BE HERE. YOU WILL BE ABLE TO READ THEM.AND YOU'LL NOTE THAT THE ACCOUNT THE DEFENDANT GAVE THE PRESS AND THE MEDIA AND THE PUBLIC WAS NOT THE SAME ACCOUNT HE GAVE NICOLE IN THOSE LETTERS DURING THAT APOLOGY PHASE, THE APOLOGY PHASE, THE CONTRITION PHASE, THE PHASE HE WAS GOING THROUGH.IN THE LETTER HE WROTE TO NICOLE, HE APOLOGIZED FOR HURTING HER. IN THE LETTER HE WROTE TO NICOLE, HE ADMITTED HE HAD LOST CONTROL. AND IN THE LETTER TO NICOLE, HE SAID THE SAME OLD THING HE'S BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG; AND THAT IS THAT, ""I WILL DO BETTER. WE CAN GET THROUGH THIS.""AND THAT HAPPENS IN BAD RELATIONSHIPS AND IN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS, DOESN'T IT? THINGS GET BAD, BAD THINGS HAPPEN. IT'S ALWAYS SOMEBODY'S FAULT, BUT NOBODY WANTS TO TAKE THE BLAME.AND IN THIS SITUATION, AND THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT WHAT THE DEFENDANT DID WAS, HE MADE THESE PROMISES. HE SORT OF ROPED HER BACK IN.YOU KNOW HOW IT IS IN A BAD RELATIONSHIP, ""I'LL DO BETTER. HERE'S A GIFT. I'M SORRY."" THEY JUST ROPE YOU BACK INTO IT.AND IF YOU ARE THE OTHER PERSON IN NICOLE'S POSITION AS SHE WAS -- AND THIS WILL BE REFLECTED IN THE EVIDENCE -- SHE WANTED TO BELIEVE, SHE WANTED TO BELIEVE THAT HER MARRIAGE COULD SURVIVE. SHE WANTED TO HAVE HOPE, AND HE GAVE HER HOPE FOR A WHILE BECAUSE THIS IS A CYCLE.AND SO HE BEAT HER UP ON JANUARY 1. HE ADMITTED TO HER PRIVATELY IN HIS LETTERS THAT HE WAS RESPONSIBLE, AND HE APOLOGIZED AND HE GAVE HER THINGS AND HE TRIED TO MAKE IT ALL BETTER, AND HE GAVE HER HOPE AND HE ROPED HER BACK IN, AND SHE STAYED. SHE STAYED BECAUSE SHE HAD HOPE AND BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO BELIEVE THAT JANUARY 1, 1989 WOULD BE THE LAST TIME THAT HE WOULD ABUSE HER PHYSICALLY OR MENTALLY.AS YOU HEAR THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE, SOMETHING VERY SAD BECOMES VERY APPARENT. THEY MET WHEN SHE WAS 18 AND HE WAS ALMOST 30, AND IN 1992, THEY DIVORCED. SHE WAS ONLY 33 YEARS OLD AND SHE DIED WHEN SHE WAS ALMOST 35.THROUGHOUT HER ADULT LIFE, THROUGHOUT MOST OF HER ADULT LIFE, HER CONCEPT OF MARRIAGE AND RELATIONSHIP WAS DEFINED BY THIS DEFENDANT. THAT WAS ADULT LOVE. HER NOTION OF ADULT LOVE FOR 15 YEARS WAS WHAT THIS DEFENDANT GAVE HER, AND HE ABUSED HER THROUGHOUT THAT RELATIONSHIP.AS I SAID BEFORE, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES YOU GET ROPED IN. PEOPLE GET ROPED IN. NICOLE GOT ROPED IN BY THE DEFENDANT, AND SHE STAYED AND SHE STAYED. AND PEOPLE STAY IN THOSE SITUATIONS, THOSE ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS FOR YEARS AND YEARS UNTIL ONE OR TWO THINGS HAPPEN; ONE, THEY JUST CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE, OR, TWO, UNTIL THEY JUST CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE AND THEY WAKE UP TO REALITY.AND FINALLY, IN 1992, NICOLE WOKE UP TO THE REALITY OF HER SITUATION, AND IN JANUARY 1992, SHE MOVED FROM ROCKINGHAM, SHE LEFT THE DEFENDANT AND SHE FILED FOR DIVORCE.WELL, THIS DID NOT SIT WELL WITH THIS DEFENDANT AND THIS WILL BE REFLECTED IN THE EVIDENCE. HE DID NOT LIKE THIS. HE DID NOT LIKE THE FACT THAT NICOLE WAS LEAVING HIS HOUSE GOING SOMEWHERE ELSE TO LIVE IN HER OWN HOUSE AWAY FROM HIM.THERE IS THAT ISSUE OF CONTROL. HOW COULD HE CONTROL HER? SHE WASN'T RIGHT THERE WITH HIM.AND HE DIDN'T TAKE IT WELL AND HE LOST 20 TO 25 POUNDS LIKE THAT (SNAPS FINGERS). AND ALSO AND ALMOST ON A DAILY BASIS, HE WOULD CALL HER SISTERS, DOMINIQUE AND TONYA AND DENISE, AND HE WOULD CALL HER MOTHER AND HER FATHER SOMETIMES CRYING ON THE TELEPHONE AND HE WOULD CALL THEM AND HE WOULD WINE TO THEM AND, YOU KNOW, AND HE WOULD TELL THEM HOW MUCH HE LOVED HER AND WANTED HER BACK. HE WOULD USE THEM TO TRY AND ROPE HER BACK IN.WELL, SHE COULDN'T LET HIM GO, NOT COMPLETELY. AND HOW COULD SHE? SHE HAD BEEN UNDER HIS CONTROL FOR 15 OR 16 YEARS.AND SO SHE DIDN'T GO TOO FAR. SHE RENTED A HOUSE IN BRENTWOOD ON GRETNA GREEN. THEY SAW EACH OTHER. THEY HAD CHILDREN TOGETHER, LOVELY CHILDREN. YOU'LL PROBABLY BE SEEING A PICTURE OF ONE PRETTY SOON.BUT HE COULDN'T DEAL WITH THE LOSS OF NICOLE. HE COULDN'T DEAL WITH NOT HAVING HER THERE. HE COULDN'T DEAL WITH THE LOSS OF CONTROL AND HE COULDN'T HELP BUT PURSUE HER.YOU'LL HEAR TESTIMONY IN THIS CASE FROM NICOLE'S MOTHER, AND SHE'LL TELL YOU ABOUT SOME OF THE TELEPHONE CONVERSATIONS SHE HAD WITH THE DEFENDANT IN 1992 AND SOME EVEN MORE RECENT. AND ONE CONVERSATION, HE TOLD HER, HE TOLD HER, HE SAID, ""ALL MY FRIENDS TELL ME THAT I SHOULD JUST LEAVE HER ALONE, JUST FORGET ABOUT IT, JUST GO ON WITH MY OWN LIFE.""AND WHEN MRS. BROWN SAID, ""WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT, LET HER GO. IF YOU LET HER GO, THEN MAYBE SHE'LL COME BACK TO YOU. JUST LET HER GO, AND MAYBE SHE'LL COME BACK,"" AND HIS RESPONSE WAS, ""I CAN'T. YOU KNOW I CAN'T. YOU KNOW I CAN'T HELP MYSELF. I CAN'T LET HER GO.""HE COULDN'T LET HER GO. HE COULDN'T HELP BUT PURSUE HER. HE COULDN'T LEAVE HER ALONE. HE COULDN'T HANDLE THE LOSS OF CONTROL. AND BECAUSE SHE HAD LEFT HIS HOUSE AND MOVED SOMEWHERE ELSE AND ESTABLISHED HER OWN HOME, HER OWN HOUSE AND BEGAN ESTABLISHING HER OWN RELATIONSHIPS, HE DID THE ONLY THING HE COULD DO TO GAIN CONTROL, TO TRY TO GAIN CONTROL, TO TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH HER, AND SO HE STALKED HER. HE STALKED HER.WHEN SHE LEFT ROCKINGHAM IN JANUARY OF '92 AND SET UP A NEW HOUSEHOLD ON GRETNA GREEN ALSO IN BRENTWOOD, SHE BEGAN DATING A MAN NAMED KEITH, KEITH ZLOMSOWITCH, AND SHE GOT A BABYSITTER FOR THEIR TWO CHILDREN.WHENEVER KEITH AND NICOLE WOULD GO OUT, NOT EVERY TIME, BUT ENOUGH, HE WOULD SHOW UP. IF THEY WENT TO A NIGHTCLUB -- AND KEITH WILL TELL YOU ABOUT THIS. HE WILL BE HERE TO TESTIFY -- DEFENDANT SHOWED UP.THEY WENT TO A RESTAURANT CALLED THE TRIST, IT HAD JUST OPENED, NICOLE AND KEITH AND SOME OTHER FRIENDS. THEY WERE THERE, THEY GOT A TABLE, THEY BEGAN TO HAVE DINNER. AND AS THEY SAT THERE HAVING DINNER, GUESS WHO SHOWED UP? GUESS WHO ATTEMPTED TO GAIN CONTROL AGAIN? THE DEFENDANT SHOWED UP. AND THAT WILL BE REFLECTED IN THE EVIDENCE AND IN THE TESTIMONY.AND WHAT HE DID IS, HE WALKED INTO THE RESTAURANT, HE SAW NICOLE AND KEITH AND HER OTHER FRIENDS, HE WENT TO ANOTHER TABLE, HE GRABBED THE CHAIR -- THE CHAIR WAS FACING IN AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION -- HE GRABBED THE CHAIR, HE TURNED IT AROUND, HE SAT THERE STARING AT KEITH AND NICOLE AND THEIR DINNER PARTY. KEITH WILL BE HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THAT WAS AN AWFULLY INTIMIDATING EXPERIENCE.WHY?THERE WAS ANOTHER INCIDENT AT THE MEZZALUNA. NICOLE WAS THERE, KEITH WAS THERE. THE DEFENDANT SUDDENLY SHOWED UP, DROVE UP IN FRONT OF THE RESTAURANT, GOT OUT OF THE CAR, WALKED UP TO THE TABLE WHERE THEY WERE SEATED, PUT HIS HANDS ON AND SAID, ""I AM O.J. SIMPSON AND SHE'S STILL MY WIFE."" WELL, SHE HAD FILED FOR DIVORCE AND MOVED OUT OF HIS HOUSE.BUT THAT WAS INTIMIDATING.AND THERE'S MORE, AND YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT THE OTHER INCIDENTS. THERE'S MORE EVIDENCE OF STALKING IN THIS CASE AND YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT THAT.THERE WAS ONE EVENING WHEN KEITH AND NICOLE, THEY WENT TO A COMEDY SHOW, AND AFTER THE SHOW, THEY WENT TO NICOLE'S HOUSE ON GRETNA GREEN. IT WAS ABOUT 3:00 IN THE MORNING. AND THEY WERE SEATED ON THE SOFA IN HER LIVING ROOM. THE KIDS, THE KIDS WERE UPSTAIRS ASLEEP. IT'S 3:00 O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING. AND KEITH AND NICOLE MADE LOVE ON THE COUCH.BUT THEY WEREN'T ALONE. THERE WAS SOMEBODY WATCHING. THERE WAS SOMEONE WATCHING THROUGH THE WINDOW. IT WAS THE DEFENDANT. AT 3:00 O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING, HE WAS LOOKING THROUGH NICOLE'S WINDOW WATCHING HER MAKE LOVE TO ANOTHER MAN.AND THE NEXT DAY, WHEN KEITH AND NICOLE WERE TOGETHER, HE WALKED RIGHT INTO HER HOUSE, AND HE WAS BESIDE HIMSELF AND HE WAS ANGRY AND HE SAID SOME VERY NAUGHTY THINGS. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE SAID TO KEITH AND NICOLE WAS THAT, HE SAID, ""I WATCHED YOU LAST NIGHT. I WATCHED YOU AND I SAW EVERYTHING.""THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THAT IS SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL BEHAVIOR TO SAY THE LEAST. THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW ALSO THAT THIS IS ALL PART OF THIS CYCLE. IT'S ALL PART OF THIS DOMINANT THEME IN THEIR RELATIONSHIP. THIS IS ALL PART OF HIS NEED TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT HER, TO KNOW WHERE SHE IS, TO KNOW WHO SHE'S WITH, TO KNOW WHAT SHE'S DOING, TO CONTROL HER.IT'S CONTROL. IT'S ALL ABOUT CONTROL.AND THOUGH HE DID NOT INTERRUPT THEM DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE ACT AND HE DIDN'T PUNCH KEITH OUT AND HE DIDN'T PUNCH NICOLE OUT, HE STILL WATCHED SO THAT HE WOULD KNOW. AND TO CONTROL HER, HE HAD TO CONFRONT HER WITH WHAT HE KNEW, TO INTIMIDATE HER, TO KEEP HER FROM DOING IT AGAIN. IT'S ALL ABOUT CONTROL.WELL, OVER THE MONTHS, YOU KNOW, NICOLE STILL WANTED TO BELIEVE THAT THEY COULD BE A FAMILY AGAIN TOGETHER. AND THEY WOULD ATTEMPT RECONCILIATION AND THEY WOULD FAIL, AND THEY WOULD ATTEMPT AGAIN.AND NICOLE WAS AS MUCH A PARTY TO THAT AS THE DEFENDANT WAS. BUT THERE WAS A SITUATION IN OCTOBER OF 1993, AN INCIDENT, ANOTHER CONTROL INCIDENT.HE FORCED HIS WAY THROUGH THE BACK DOOR OF HER PLACE ON GRETNA GREEN. HE FORCED HER DOOR IN. HE ENTERED HER HOUSE WITHOUT HER PERMISSION, WITHOUT HER KNOWLEDGE AND HE CONFRONTED HER AND HE SCARED HER, HE FRIGHTENED HER. AND HE SCARED HER SO BADLY THAT SHE TELEPHONED 911, AND SHE ASKED FOR POLICE ASSISTANCE.AND YOU WILL HEAR THE TAPE OF THAT 911 CALL AND YOU WILL SEE THE 911 OPERATOR AND YOU WILL HEAR THE DEFENDANT IN THE BACKGROUND. THIS IS OCTOBER 1993.HE WATCHED KEITH AND NICOLE HAVE SEX IN APRIL OF 1992. AND WHEN YOU LISTEN TO THE OCTOBER 1993 911 TAPE, YOU CAN HEAR HIM IN THE BACKGROUND STILL YELLING AND SHOUTING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN APRIL OF 1992.BUT THAT 911 TAPE IS A TELLING GLIMPSE INTO THEIR RELATIONSHIP THAT'S FOR SURE, AND IT'S ALSO AN EXAMPLE OF THIS DEFENDANT'S PRIVATE SIDE, HIS PRIVATE FACE, THE OTHER MAN, THE MAN IN THE COURTROOM, THE MAN THAT'S ON TRIAL HERE TODAY.AND YOU WILL HEAR NICOLE ON THE TELEPHONE TALKING TO THE OPERATOR. AND AS YOU LISTEN TO HER, YOU CAN'T HELP BUT DISCERN FROM THE TONE OF HER VOICE AND THE THINGS THAT SHE SAYS THAT SHE IS A TOUGH WOMAN, BUT THAT SHE'S ALSO AFRAID AND INTIMIDATED. AND NOT ONLY THAT, BUT THAT SHE FEELS THAT HER SITUATION IS HOPELESS.THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT BY OCTOBER OF 1993, NICOLE, HER SITUATION WAS HOPELESS AND SHE WAS HELPLESS.WAY BACK IN 1989, THE DEFENDANT SAID THAT THE POLICE HAD BEEN TO THE HOUSE EIGHT TIMES BEFORE AND NEVER DONE ANYTHING. NICOLE SAID THE SAME THING ON THE TELEPHONE TO THE 911 OPERATOR IN 1993.HER SITUATION WAS HOPELESS AND SHE WAS HELPLESS. AND YOU CAN INFER FROM THE EVIDENCE THAT NICOLE BROWN EXPECTED OR HAD NO EXPECTATION THAT ANYONE WOULD EVER DO ANYTHING TO THIS DEFENDANT BECAUSE HE BEAT HER. THERE WAS NO HELP COMING AND SHE DIDN'T EXPECT ANY HELP.BUT YOU WILL HEAR THAT TELEPHONE CALL AND YOU WILL HEAR THE DEFENDANT AND YOU WILL GET A TRUE SENSE OF THE FEAR HE INSTILLED IN HER. AND HE DIDN'T HIT HER THAT DAY. HE DIDN'T STRIKE HER. HE DIDN'T PUNCH HER. HE DID GO THROUGH THE HOUSE TO SEE WHO WAS THERE, BUT HE DIDN'T HURT HER THAT DAY.STILL, SHE STAYED. STILL, THEY REMAINED INVOLVED, NOT ONLY IN A SENSE THAT HE WAS THE FATHER OF HER CHILDREN, BUT THEY STILL ATTEMPTED TO RECONCILE.AND OVER THE MONTHS AFTER OCTOBER OF 1993, THEY TRIED TO GET TOGETHER AND THEY FAILED, THEY TRIED TO GET TOGETHER AND THEY FAILED. AND IN MAY OF 1994, IT WAS NICOLE'S BIRTHDAY, AND THE DEFENDANT GAVE HER A VERY NICE GIFT, A PIECE OF JEWELRY. AND THEY ATTEMPTED TO RECONCILE FOR LACK OF A BETTER DESCRIPTION, BUT THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT IT WAS A VERY BRIEF ATTEMPT BECAUSE A FEW DAYS LATER, NICOLE CALLED IT QUITS.SHE WOKE UP TO THE TRUE REALITY OF HER SITUATION. SHE COULDN'T BE BALKED ANYMORE. SHE COULDN'T LIVE LIKE THAT. AND THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT SHE LET THE DEFENDANT KNOW THAT IT WAS OVER. THIS IS IT, HASTA LA VISTA.AND THIS WAS SIGNIFICANT IN THE MIND OF THIS DEFENDANT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. IT WAS SOMETHING THAT HAD NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.HE WOULD DO THINGS TO HER AND HE WOULD TRY TO APPEASE HER BY GIVING HER THINGS, AND SHE WOULD ACCEPT THOSE THINGS AND THEY WOULD RECONCILE. BUT NOT THIS DAY. THIS DAY, SHE COULDN'T BE APPEASED. SHE COULDN'T BE BOUGHT. SHE COULDN'T BE BRIBED. SHE HAD HAD ENOUGH.AND THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT SHE LET THE DEFENDANT KNOW THAT. AND THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT FINALLY, AFTER 17 YEARS, HE FINALLY GOT THE MESSAGE. IT FINALLY BECAME CLEAR THAT SHE WANTED TO LIVE HER OWN LIFE AND THAT IN HER LIFE, THAT HE WAS NOT GOING TO BE A PART OF IT.SHE COULDN'T HANDLE IT. SHE WOKE UP TO REALITY. SHE WANTED TO LIVE AND HAVE HER OWN IDENTITY. SHE NO LONGER WANTED TO BE UNDER HIS CONTROL, UNDER HIS THUMB. SHE LET HIM KNOW THAT IT WAS OVER, THAT IT WAS OVER, IT WAS OVER AND IT WAS FINAL, BUT THIS DEFENDANT'S PRIVATE SIDE, THE OTHER MAN, NOT THE ONE ON T.V., THE DEFENDANT, HE COULDN'T TAKE THAT. HE COULDN'T ACCEPT THAT. HE COULD NOT ACCEPT THAT LOSS OF CONTROL, AND HE WOULDN'T AND HE DIDN'T.ON JUNE 12, A DANCE RECITAL WAS HELD IN BRENTWOOD FOR THE DEFENDANT'S DAUGHTER SIDNEY. THE ENTIRE BROWN FAMILY WENT TO THE RECITAL AS DID SOME FRIENDS, CANDICE GARVEY FOR INSTANCE.THE AUDITORIUM WAS CROWDED. SO NOT EVERYONE COULD SIT, YOU KNOW, NEXT TO A FAMILY MEMBER. AND SO THEIR PARTY WAS, YOU KNOW -- THERE WERE PEOPLE BETWEEN THEM. THEY WERE SEPARATED SOMEWHAT AND DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAD TO SIT IN DIFFERENT ROWS AND NOT ALL TOGETHER.WELL, THE DEFENDANT ARRIVED LATE AND HE ARRIVED CARRYING A BOUQUET OF FLOWERS, FLOWERS HE HAD BOUGHT FOR HIS DAUGHTER.WELL, WHEN HE WALKED INTO THE AUDITORIUM, HE GREETED JUST ABOUT EVERYONE IN THE PARTY IN THE BROWN FAMILY. HE SAID HELLO TO THEM, HE KISSED DENISE ON THE CHEEK, ""HOW ARE YOU, HOW YOU DOING,"" WHATEVER, AND HE PRETTY MUCH ADDRESSED EVERYBODY EXCEPT NICOLE.HE SAT BEHIND THE BROWN'S FOR A FEW MOMENTS. AND THEN HE GOT UP AND HE GRABBED A CHAIR AND HE DRAGGED IT IN THE CORNER OF THE AUDITORIUM AND HE TURNED THAT CHAIR AROUND AND HE SAT IN IT, AND HE SAT THERE FACING NICOLE AND HE JUST STARED AT HER. HE JUST SAT THERE STARING AT HER.AND YOU'LL HEAR TESTIMONY ABOUT THIS, AND THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THIS WAS A MENACING STARE, A PENETRATING STARE, IT WAS AN ANGRY STARE, AND IT MADE EVERYONE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.WHEN THE RECITAL WAS OVER, THERE WAS A LITTLE ISSUE WHETHER OR NOT THE DEFENDANT WAS ALLOWED TO GIVE SIDNEY SOME FLOWERS, AND HE GAVE HER SOME FLOWERS. BUT THE BROWN FAMILY HAD DECIDED TO GO OVER TO THE MEZZALUNA RESTAURANT FOR DINNER. AND AS THEY LEFT, THEY MADE IT CLEAR TO THE DEFENDANT THAT HE WAS NOT INVITED, AND HE WASN'T INVITED.AND BY NOT INVITING HIM, IT WAS A REAFFIRMATION OF WHAT HE HAD ALREADY BEEN TOLD, AND THAT IS THAT IT WAS OVER. HE WAS NO LONGER BEING TREATED AS A PART OF THE FAMILY. HE WAS NO LONGER THE CENTRAL CENTERPIECE OF EVERY FAMILY OUTING. NICOLE WAS GETTING ON WITH HER OWN LIFE.AND AS THE BROWN FAMILY LEFT, THEY LOOKED TOWARD THE DEFENDANT AND THEY SAW HIM, AND HE WAS ANGRY AND HE WAS DEPRESSED AND THEY WERE CONCERNED AND EVERYONE WONDERED WHAT IS HE UP TO NOW. MISS CLARK WILL TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT THE DEFENDANT WAS UP TO AS THE DAY PROCEEDED ON.BUT THERE'S SOME THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS EVIDENCE AS YOU HEAR IT.THIS IS NOT CHARACTER ASSASSINATION. THIS IS EVIDENCE OF A CONTROLLING PERSONALITY, OF A CONTROLLING RELATIONSHIP, THIS PROOF OF JEALOUSY.AND AS MISS CLARK TALKS AND THE EVIDENCE DEVELOPS IN THIS CASE AND AS YOU HEAR IT AND SEE IT AND PROCESS IT, YOU WILL SEE THAT CYCLE OF VIOLENCE. YOU WILL SEE HOW THINGS ESCALATED. YOU'LL SEE HOW CONTROLLING HE IS AND YOU'LL SEE WHY HE WOULD KILL ON JUNE 12.THIS IS NOT CHARACTER ASSASSINATION. THIS IS NOT SOME TABLOID PROSECUTION. THE EVIDENCE YOU HEAR IN THIS CASE WILL BE EVIDENCE OF THIS DEFENDANT'S LIFE, OF HIS CONDUCT, THE THINGS HE DID.YOU WILL HEAR EVIDENCE OF HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH ONE OF THE VICTIMS. AND AS YOU HEAR IT, YOU WILL -- AS YOU HEAR THE EVIDENCE AND AS YOU LISTEN TO MISS CLARK, YOU'LL SEE HOW IT IS THAT RON GOLDMAN HAPPENED TO BE AT THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME.AS YOU LISTEN TO THE EVIDENCE, YOU WILL SEE THAT HIS DECISION TO KILL FINALLY WAS MERELY A FINAL LINK IN A PROGRESSIVE CHAIN OF ABUSIVE AND CONTROLLING CONDUCT, AND IT WAS A CHAIN THAT CONSISTED OF FEAR AND INTIMIDATION AND BATTERY AND EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL ABUSE AND ECONOMIC ABUSE AND CONTROL AND STALKING.AND YOU'LL SEE THAT THERE WAS A COMMON SCHEME AND COMMON PLAN IN ALL OF THIS, AND THAT WAS TO CONTROL, TO CONTROL HER. IT WAS ALL DESIGNED JUST TO CONTROL HER. AND IN CONTROLLING HER, IT WAS THE PRIVATE MAN, PRIVATE O.J. SIMPSON, IT WAS THE DEFENDANT WHO COMMITTED THAT FINAL ULTIMATE ACT OF CONTROL.SHE LEFT HIM. SHE WAS NO LONGER IN HIS CONTROL. HE WAS OBSESSED WITH HER. HE COULD NOT STAND TO LOSE HER, AND SO HE MURDERED HER.AND AS YOU HEAR THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE, IT WILL BECOME CLEAR THAT IN HIS MIND, SHE BELONGED TO HIM; AND IF HE COULDN'T HAVE HER, THEN NOBODY COULD.THANK YOU.

#MS. CLARK: ,"MR. WOODY CLARK AND MR. ROCHMOND HARMON.THEY WILL ALL BE PRESENTING THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE THAT RELATES TO THE BLOOD ANALYSIS AND DNA TESTING.WHEN YOU HEAR THE AMOUNT OF EVIDENCE THAT WE HAVE, YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHY I NEED THE HELP. AND I THANK THEM VERY MUCH FOR THEIR ABLE ASSISTANCE THUS FAR.OF COURSE, YOU KNOW MR. HODGMAN. HE'S STILL HERE.YOU'VE NOW HEARD THE WHY. YOU'VE HEARD WHY. WHY WOULD ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON, A MAN WHO SEEMINGLY HAD IT ALL, COMMIT SUCH HEINOUS CRIMES, THROW IT ALL AWAY?THE ONE SIMPLE TRUTH ABOUT THE EVIDENCE DESCRIBED TO YOU BY MR. DARDEN IS THAT IT SHOWS THAT MR. SIMPSON IS A MAN, NOT A STEREOTYPE, BUT FLESH AND BLOOD WHO CAN DO BOTH GOOD AND EVIL. BEING WEALTHY, BEING FAMOUS CANNOT CHANGE ONE SIMPLE TRUTH. HE'S A PERSON, AND PEOPLE HAVE GOOD SIDES AND BAD SIDES. WHETHER YOU SEE BOTH SIDES OR NOT, BOTH SIDES ARE ALWAYS THERE.NOW, WE WILL SHOW YOU THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SMILING FACE YOU SAW IN THE HERTZ COMMERCIAL, THE ONE YOU NEVER SAW ON CAMERA, THE ONE NONE OF US EVER WANTED TO SEE. AND THAT WAS THE SIDE THAT WENT FROM ROCKINGHAM AT HIS ESTATE TO NICOLE'S HOME AT 875 SOUTH BUNDY ON THE NIGHT OF JUNE THE 12TH, 1994.NOW, ON THAT NIGHT, MANY EVENTS WERE HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME. AND IN ORDER TO GIVE YOU A TRUE PICTURE, THE MOST CLEAR AND ACCURATE PICTURE OF WHAT REALLY HAPPENED, HOW THE EVENTS OCCURRED, I'M GOING TO GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND BETWEEN THE LOCATIONS.SO WHAT I WANT TO DO FIRST OF ALL IS DESCRIBE THE SETTING FOR YOU.AS OF JUNE THE 12TH, 1994, NICOLE WAS LIVING AT 875 SOUTH BUNDY IN BRENTWOOD. THAT'S A CONDOMINIUM. IT WAS A DUPLEX. AND SO IT'S ONE BUILDING. SHE HAD ONE SIDE, HAD A COMMON WALL AND HER NEIGHBORS HAD ANOTHER SIDE.SHE LIVED THERE WITH HER TWO CHILDREN, JUSTIN AND SIDNEY. THE DEFENDANT WAS LIVING AT 360 ROCKINGHAM AVENUE IN BRENTWOOD.BRIAN KAELIN, KNOWN AS KATO -- YOU'VE -- SOME OF YOU ALREADY ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE NAME -- WAS LIVING IN ONE OF THE GUEST UNITS BEHIND THE DEFENDANT'S HOME ON ROCKINGHAM AVENUE. THE DEFENDANT'S DAUGHTER ARNELLE LIVED NEXT TO KATO IN ANOTHER ONE OF THE GUEST UNITS.I'LL SHOW YOU A DIAGRAM A LITTLE BIT LATER TO GET YOU MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE LOCATION. BUT THE GUEST UNITS ARE BEHIND AND APART FROM THE MAIN HOUSE AND THEY SHARE COMMON WALLS. IT'S KIND OF LIKE ONE LONG BUILDING. SO KATO HAD ONE AND THEN ARNELLE HAD THE NEXT ONE.NOW, THE BACKGROUND ON KATO AND WHAT THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW YOU IS THE FOLLOWING:KATO MET NICOLE IN 1992 AFTER SHE HAD LEFT THE DEFENDANT AT A PARTY IN ASPEN. THEY REMAINED FRIENDLY AFTER THAT POINT NOT ROMANTICALLY; PLATONIC, JUST FRIENDS.AND HE WENT TO A PARTY THAT SHE GAVE AT GRETNA GREEN IN 1993. HE NOTICED THAT THAT HOUSE HAD A GUEST UNIT BEHIND IT THAT WAS A SEPARATE LIVING QUARTERS, AND HE ASKED NICOLE IF HE COULD RENT THAT LOCATION. SHE SAID YES.SHE RENTED IT TO HIM FOR $450 TO $500 A MONTH AND HE WAS ALLOWED TO REDUCE THAT AMOUNT IF HE DID BABY-SITTING FOR HER. HE WAS VERY GOOD WITH THE CHILDREN. SO THAT WAS AN ARRANGEMENT THAT WORKED WELL FOR EVERYONE. HOWEVER, NICOLE DECIDED TO MOVE OUT OF GRETNA GREEN IN 1994, AND SHE FOUND THE RESIDENCE ON BUNDY THAT I'VE DESCRIBED TO YOU.NOW, THE BUNDY RESIDENCE DID HAVE SEPARATE QUARTERS WITH ITS OWN ENTRANCE AND EXIT, BUT IT WAS ALL UNDER ONE ROOF. IT DIDN'T HAVE A SEPARATE LIVING QUARTERS LIKE THE OTHER HOUSE DID ON GRETNA GREEN.THE DEFENDANT ASKED KATO NOT TO STAY THERE, NOT TO LIVE UNDER THE SAME ROOF AS NICOLE SAYING IT WOULDN'T BE APPROPRIATE, AND HE ASKED KATO TO COME STAY IN ONE OF THE GUEST UNITS AT HIS HOUSE ON ROCKINGHAM. HE TOLD KATO HE COULD STAY THERE FOR FREE.KATO OBVIOUSLY SAW A MUCH BETTER FINANCIAL SITUATION FOR HIMSELF AND AGREED. AND SO IN JANUARY OF 1994, KATO MOVED TO THE GUEST UNIT BEHIND THE DEFENDANT'S HOUSE ON ROCKINGHAM AND NICOLE MOVED TO 875 SOUTH BUNDY.LET ME SHOW YOU A BOARD NOW OF THE ROCKINGHAM LOCATION.

I'LL GET INTO MORE DETAIL LATER.NOW, BEFORE I REALLY GET INTO THE EVENTS OF THE NIGHT OF JUNE THE 12TH AND INTO ALL THE DETAILS, THERE ARE A FEW KEY POINTS THAT I WANT TO BRING OUT TO YOU RIGHT NOW. I'LL COME BACK TO THEM AGAIN, BUT I WANT YOU TO BEAR THEM IN MIND.THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE TIMING OF THE EVENTS THAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT. YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THAT THROUGHOUT THIS TRIAL. I THINK I CAN GUARANTEE THAT.WITH RESPECT TO THE TIMING, THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT ON THE NIGHT OF JUNE THE 12TH, 1994, THE DEFENDANT HAD AN HOUR AND 10 MINUTES OF TIME IN WHICH HIS WHEREABOUTS ARE UNACCOUNTED FOR. AND WE WILL SHOW THAT IT WAS DURING THAT HOUR AND 10 MINUTES THAT THE MURDERS WERE COMMITTED.AND SO THE EVIDENCE WILL PROVE THAT KATO LAST SAW THE DEFENDANT ON THE NIGHT OF JUNE THE 12TH AT 9:35 AT THE LATEST, HE DID NOT SEE THE DEFENDANT AGAIN UNTIL 10 -- EXCUSE ME -- AFTER 11:00 O'CLOCK.IN BETWEEN THOSE TWO TIMES, AT 10:15, A DOG IS HEARD BARKING THAT THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW WAS NICOLE'S DOG, WHICH FIXES THE TIME AT WHICH THE MURDER OCCURRED.AT 10:45, KATO HEARD THUMPS ON HIS WALL. AND SHORTLY AFTER 11:00, HE SAW THE DEFENDANT. AN HOUR AND 10 MINUTES DURING WHICH THE MURDER OCCURRED -- MURDERS OCCURRED IN WHICH THE DEFENDANT'S WHEREABOUTS ARE UNACCOUNTED FOR. I'LL COME BACK TO THAT POINT.NOW, ON THE NIGHT OF JUNE THE 12TH, AS MR. DARDEN HAS ALREADY DESCRIBED TO YOU, THAT WAS THE RECITAL FOR SIDNEY. IT WAS A DANCE RECITAL FOR HER SCHOOL.ON THE MORNING OF JUNE THE 12TH, THE DEFENDANT PLAYED GOLF, PLAYED CARDS AND HE WAS SCHEDULED TO GO TO THE RECITAL AT 5:00 P.M. ON THE EVENING OF JUNE THE 12TH.MR. DARDEN DESCRIBED TO YOU HOW DEFENDANT BEHAVED THAT NIGHT. HE WAS IN AN UGLY MOOD, MOROSE, DEPRESSED AND CLEARLY FIXATED ON HIS EX-WIFE NICOLE BROWN.HE RETURNED HOME AFTER THE RECITAL AND HE SPOKE TO KATO. IT WAS APPROXIMATELY 6:30 TO 7:00 P.M. HE RETURNED HOME, TO HIS HOME ON ROCKINGHAM.NOW, ABOUT THAT SAME TIME, 6:30 TO 7:00 P.M., NICOLE WAS ARRIVING AT THE MEZZALUNA WITH HER PARTY, THAT WAS ALL OF HER FAMILY AND SIDNEY AND JUSTIN.NOW, BACK AT ROCKINGHAM, MR. SIMPSON SPOKE TO KATO. HE DISCUSSED A LITTLE BIT THE RECITAL, WHAT HE WANTED TO TELL HIM ABOUT IT AND HE MENTIONED TO HIM THAT NICOLE WAS WEARING A TIGHT DRESS AND HE WONDERED HOW SHE WOULD LOOK IN THAT TIGHT DRESS WHEN SHE GOT TO BE OLDER. DURING THE COURSE OF THAT DAY, HE ALSO TOLD KATO THAT HE AND NICOLE WERE THROUGH.IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THE DEFENDANT WOULD MAKE STATEMENTS SOUNDING LIKE HE WAS CAVALIER ABOUT IT. BUT THE TRUTH THAT WE LEARN FROM THE INSIDE IS THAT HE WAS NOT AT ALL CAVALIER ABOUT LOSING NICOLE.NOW, WHILE THE DEFENDANT IS TALKING TO KATO ON ROCKINGHAM, NICOLE AND HER PARTY ARRIVED AT THE MEZZALUNA FOR DINNER TO CELEBRATE SIDNEY'S RECITAL. RON GOLDMAN WAS A WAITER AT THE MEZZALUNA. HE DIDN'T WAIT ON HER TABLE THAT NIGHT, BUT HE WAS WORKING THERE THAT NIGHT. NICOLE WAS WEARING A BLACK HALTER DRESS AND A BLACK BLAZER. SHE LEFT THE RESTAURANT WITH HER FAMILY AT APPROXIMATELY 8:30 P.M.NOW, BETWEEN 8:30 AND 9:00 P.M., KATO WAS BACK IN HIS ROOM, AND THE DEFENDANT CAME OUT TO HIS ROOM TO ASK HIM FOR SOME CHANGE. THE DEFENDANT WAS SET TO TAKE A FLIGHT OUT THAT NIGHT TO CHICAGO, THE 11:45 RED EYE. HE INDICATED TO KATO THAT HE ONLY HAD HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS AND HE NEEDED SMALLER CHANGE FOR THE SKY CAP. HE ASKED KATO IF HE HAD THAT SMALLER CHANGE AND KATO SAID HE DID.HE THEN TOLD KATO THAT HE WAS GOING TO GO OUT AND GET SOMETHING TO EAT. KATO ASKED IF HE COULD COME ALONG. THE DEFENDANT SAID OKAY.THEY THEN LEFT AND THEY WENT OUT TO THE DRIVEWAY. THE DEFENDANT DROVE TO MC DONALD'S IN HIS BLACK BENTLEY. THEY GOT SOME BURGERS. AND AS HE DROVE BACK, THE DEFENDANT ATE HIS FOOD WHILE HE WAS DRIVING. KATO DID NOT.THEY GOT BACK TO 365 ROCKINGHAM, AND THE DEFENDANT PARKED HIS BENTLEY IN THE DRIVEWAY IN THE SAME POSITION IN WHICH IT WAS FOUND BY THE POLICE IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OF JUNE THE 13TH.WHEN KATO GOT OUT OF THE CAR, IT WAS 9:30 TO 9:35 AT THE LATEST. AND WHEN HE GOT OUT OF THE CAR, HE LAST SAW THE DEFENDANT STANDING NEAR THE BENTLEY. KATO WALKED THROUGH THE DRIVEWAY, THROUGH THE SIDE YARD AND BACK TO HIS ROOM. AS SOON AS HE GOT BACK TO HIS ROOM, HE MADE A CALL TO HIS FRIEND IN SAN DIEGO AT 9:37.SO WE KNOW THAT THE DEFENDANT GOT HOME BETWEEN 9:30 TO 9:35 AT THE VERY LATEST BASED ON THE TIMING OF THE PHONE CALL THAT KATO PLACED TO HIS FRIEND IN SAN DIEGO. WHEN KATO LEFT THE DEFENDANT STANDING AT THE BENTLEY AT 9:35, HE DID NOT SEE THE DEFENDANT AGAIN UNTIL AFTER 11:00 P.M.NOW, WHAT I'M ABOUT TO DESCRIBE TO YOU IS A SERIES OF EVENTS THAT PROVES THAT THE MURDERS OCCURRED BETWEEN 9:35 AND 10:45 ON THE NIGHT OF JUNE THE 12TH AND THAT DURING THAT TIME, THE DEFENDANT'S WHEREABOUTS ARE UNACCOUNTED FOR.AT 9:37, JUDITHA BROWN, THAT IS NICOLE'S MOTHER, CALLED THE MEZZALUNA TO SEE IF THEY HAD FOUND HER PRESCRIPTION GLASSES THAT SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD LEFT THERE AT DINNER THAT NIGHT.KAREN CRAWFORD, THE BAR MANAGER FROM MEZZALUNA, TOOK THAT CALL AND THEN WENT TO LOOK FOR THE GLASSES. SHE FOUND THEM OUT IN THE GUTTER NEAR WHERE THE FAMILY HAD GOTTEN OUT OF THEIR CAR TO COME INTO THE RESTAURANT.SHE BROUGHT THEM BACK INTO THE RESTAURANT, TOLD JUDITHA THAT SHE HAD FOUND THEM. JUDITHA ASKED HER TO KEEP THE GLASSES THERE. SO MISS CRAWFORD PUT THEM INTO AN ENVELOPE MARKED ""NICOLE SIMPSON PRESCRIPTION GLASSES"".WE'LL SHOW YOU PHOTOGRAPHS OF THAT ENVELOPE TODAY.NOW, JUDITHA CALLED NICOLE AT 9:40 P.M. AND TOLD HER THAT THE GLASSES HAD BEEN FOUND AND WERE BEING KEPT AT THE MEZZALUNA AT 9:40 P.M. AND THAT WAS THE LAST TIME JUDITHA EVER SPOKE TO HER DAUGHTER NICOLE.A FEW MINUTES LATER, MISS CRAWFORD RECEIVED A CALL FROM NICOLE, AND THEY SPOKE. MISS CRAWFORD THEN CALLED RON GOLDMAN OVER TO THE PHONE. RON GOLDMAN SPOKE TO NICOLE FOR A FEW MINUTES, AND WHEN HE WAS DONE AND HE HUNG UP, MISS CRAWFORD GAVE HIM THE GLASSES, AND HE TOOK THE ENVELOPE CONTAINING THOSE GLASSES.SHORTLY THEREAFTER AT APPROXIMATELY 9:50 P.M., RON GOLDMAN LEFT THE RESTAURANT STILL DRESSED IN HIS WAITER'S UNIFORM, THE WHITE DRESS SHIRT, THE BLACK PANTS AND THE BLACK SHOES. AND HIS FRIENDS AT THE RESTAURANT NEVER AGAIN SAW HIM ALIVE.

#MS. CLARK: ,"THIS GARAGE AND THESE LIVING QUARTERS HERE BELONG TO ANOTHER FAMILY (INDICATING). AS I INDICATED BEFORE, IT'S A DUPLEX.SO AT 10:15, PABLO FENJVES HEARD A DOG BARK. HE REMEMBERED IT CLEARLY BECAUSE THE BARK WAS LIKE A PLAINTIVE INSISTENT WAIL. IT WAS LIKE NOTHING HE EVER HEARD BEFORE. ALTHOUGH HE HEARD DOGS BARK IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AS OTHER DOGS LIVED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, THIS WAS DIFFERENT. THIS DOG SOUNDED LIKE A DOG IN TROUBLE.AT 11:00 P.M., WHEN PABLO FENJVES WENT TO BED, THE DOG WAS STILL BARKING. HE WENT OVER TO HIS -- BACK TO HIS BEDROOM SHUTTERS AND OPENED THEM TO LOOK OUT IN THE DIRECTION THAT THE BARKING SEEMED TO BE COMING FROM AND HE LOOKED IN THE DIRECTION OF NICOLE'S CONDOMINIUM, WHICH IS THE DIRECTION THAT IT SEEMED TO BE COMING FROM, AND HE NOTICED THAT THERE WERE LIGHTS ON IN THE UPPER FLOOR OF HER CONDO.WHEN HE FELL ASLEEP SHORTLY AFTER 11:00 O'CLOCK, THE DOG WAS STILL BARKING. THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THIS DOG WAILING AND BARKING SO INSISTENTLY WAS NICOLE'S WHITE AKIDA KATO.ANOTHER NEIGHBOR, STEVE SCHWAB, LEFT TO TAKE HIS DOG FOR A WALK AT APPROXIMATELY 10:30. AT ABOUT 10:55, WHEN HE GOT TO THE CORNER OF DOROTHY AND BUNDY, WHICH IS RIGHT ON THE CORNER OF NICOLE'S -- WHERE NICOLE LIVED, MAYBE ONE HOUSE DOWN, HE SAW KATO THE DOG WALKING ALONE.THE DOG WAS ACTING VERY AGITATED, SEEMED TO BE BARKING AT THE HOUSE ON THE CORNER OF DOROTHY AND BUNDY. HE COULDN'T TELL WHICH ONE, AND HE NOTICED THAT THE DOG HAD AN EXPENSIVE COLLAR. WHEN HE CHECKED IT FURTHER, LOOKING FOR TAGS, HE NOTICED THAT THERE WAS BLOOD ON THE PAWS AND ON THE LEGS OF THE DOG. ALTHOUGH AT THAT TIME HE SAW NO INJURY, HE ASSUMED THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A CUT ON THE PAW TO CAUSE ALL THAT BLOOD.AS HE CONTINUED TO WALK, THE DOG BEGAN TO FOLLOW HIM, BUT IT BEHAVED IN A VERY STRANGE MANNER BECAUSE AT THE WALKWAY TO EVERY HOUSE THAT THEY PASSED, THE DOG WOULD STOP AND BARK INSISTENTLY.WHEN STEVE GOT HOME AT APPROXIMATELY 11:05, HE AND HIS WIFE DISCUSSED WHAT TO DO WITH THIS DOG. THEY SAT OUTSIDE AND GAVE IT SOME WATER BECAUSE IT SEEMED VERY DEHYDRATED AND DECIDED TO TRY TO GET IT TO LEAD THEM TO ITS OWNER'S HOME.SO THEY TOOK IT OUT AND THEY STARTED TO WALK BACK. BUT AS THEY NEARED BUNDY, THE DOG RESISTED, THE DOG PULLED BACK AND THEY COULDN'T GET IT TO GO ANY FARTHER. SO HE TOOK THE DOG BACK TO THE COURTYARD OF THEIR APARTMENT BUILDING.NOW, IN THAT COURTYARD, THERE WAS MORE LIGHT AND THEY WERE ABLE TO SEE MORE CLEARLY THAT THERE WAS NO INJURY ON THE DOG, BUT THAT ITS PAWS AND ITS LEGS WERE CLEARLY BLOODY.NOW, STEVE SCHWAB LATER GAVE THAT DOG TO ANOTHER NEIGHBOR IN HIS APARTMENT BUILDING, SUKRU BOZTEPE. YOU WILL SEE THEM TESTIFY IN THIS COURTROOM. AND SUKRU BOZTEPE AGREED TO TAKE CARE OF THE DOG FOR THE NIGHT.BUT AGAIN, THE DOG WAS ACTING VERY AGITATED WITH SUKRU BOZTEPE. HE TRIED TO TAKE HIM INSIDE THE HOUSE AND HE WAS NICHING AND SCRATCHING AND TRYING TO GET OUT. SO HE TRIED TO DO THE SAME THING THAT STEVE DID, AND HE TOOK THE DOG OUT FOR A WALK HOPING IT WOULD LEAD HIM BACK TO THE OWNER'S HOME.AS THEY WENT SOUTH ON BUNDY, THE DOG STARTED PULLING HARDER AND HARDER UNTIL THEY GOT TO THE LOCATION OF 875 SOUTH BUNDY. AND THERE AT THE PATHWAY LEADING UP TO THAT HOME, THE DOG STOPPED AND THE DOG LOOKED UP THE PATHWAY. AND THAT MADE SUKRU LOOK UP THE PATHWAY, AND THERE HE SAW A SIGHT THAT HE'LL NEVER FORGET. HE SAW THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN LYING AT THE FOOT OF THE STEPS IN A POOL OF BLOOD.NOW, I'M GOING TO BACKTRACK FOR A MOMENT AND TALK ABOUT ROCKINGHAM.I LAST MENTIONED KATO AT 9:35. HE WAS ON THE PHONE TO HIS FRIEND IN SAN DIEGO. HE WAS ON THAT PHONE FOR SEVEN MINUTES. THAT CALL ENDED AT 9:44, AT WHICH POINT, AFTER TRYING TO USE THE TYPEWRITER IN THAT OFFICE I SHOWED YOU BEFORE, WHICH IS RIGHT NEXT TO HIS GUEST UNIT -- THIS MUST BE THE ROOM RIGHT HERE (INDICATING) -- HE CALLED HIS FRIEND RACHEL FERRARA.

CLARK: ,"I FORGOT TO INTRODUCE A VERY IMPORTANT MEMBER OF OUR TEAM, AND I SINCERELY APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.JONATHAN FAIRTLOUGH, WHO IS A NEW MEMBER OF OUR OFFICE, AND HE DOES ALL THE TECHNICAL WORK YOU ARE SEEING HERE AND I WOULDN'T HAVE A CLUE HOW TO OPERATE THESE THINGS. WITHOUT HIM I AM IN SERIOUS TROUBLE.I HOPE YOU ALL HAD A VERY GOOD LUNCH.LET ME REMIND YOU WHERE WE LEFT OFF SO THAT WE CAN PICK UP FROM THERE. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE TIMING AND I WAS DISCUSSING WITH YOU THAT KATO HAD LAST SEEN THE DEFENDANT AT 9:35 AT ROCKINGHAM AND THAT IT WAS AFTER 11:00 BEFORE HE SAW HIM AGAIN, SO HE SAW THE DEFENDANT AT 9:35, DID NOT SEE HIM AGAIN UNTIL AFTER 11:00, AND DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME THE DEFENDANT'S WHEREABOUTS ARE UNACCOUNTED FOR.NOW, LAST I SPOKE TO YOU KATO WAS ON THE PHONE WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND, RACHEL FERRARA. AT THAT TIME -- AT THAT SAME TIME THAT HE WAS ON THE TELEPHONE, AND THIS WAS PROBABLY 10:00 TO 10:15, ALLAN PARK, A LIMOUSINE DRIVER, WAS ON HIS WAY TO ROCKINGHAM TO PICK UP THE DEFENDANT TO TAKE HIM TO THE AIRPORT WHERE HE WOULD TAKE HIS FLIGHT AT 11:45 TO CHICAGO.NOW, ALTHOUGH HIS INSTRUCTIONS WERE TO ARRIVE AT ROCKINGHAM AT 10:45, HE HADN'T BEEN IN THE BRENTWOOD AREA BEFORE AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE LATE, SO HE LEFT EARLY AND HE ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM AT 10:25.NOW, I'M GOING TO USE THE DIAGRAM AGAIN.

#MS. CLARK: ,"WHEN ALLAN PARK PULLED UP ON ASHFORD STREET HE PARKED ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE DEFENDANT'S RESIDENCE, GOT OUT OF HIS CAR, SAT BEHIND IT ON THE CURB AND HAD A CIGARETTE. HE GOT BACK IN HIS CAR AT ABOUT 10:30, SAT IN HIS CAR FOR A FEW MINUTES LISTENING TO THE RADIO.AND AT 10:35 HE DECIDED THAT HE WOULD GO AND LOOK AT THE ROCKINGHAM GATE TO SEE IF THAT DRIVE IN WOULD BE EASIER FOR HIM THAN THE ASHFORD STREET GATE.WHAT I SHOULD TELL YOU RIGHT HERE IS THAT HE WAS DRIVING A STRETCH LIMOUSINE AND THAT HAS A VERY HARD TIME MAKING TIGHT CURVES. HE WANTED TO BE ABLE TO PULL UP IN FRONT OF THE FRONT DOOR TO AN AREA THAT WOULD BE EASIER TO LOAD THE BAGGAGE, SO HE WANTED TO SEE IF THE ROCKINGHAM ENTRANCE WOULD BE MORE EASY FOR HIM THAN THE ASHFORD STREET ADDRESS.SO HE DECIDED TO PULL DOWN TO ROCKINGHAM. HE PULLED THE LIMOUSINE DOWN TO ROCKINGHAM, ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE POINT WHERE THE DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW WOULD BE PARALLEL WITH THE ROCKINGHAM GATE, SO HE COULD LOOK INSIDE.NOW, IN DOING THAT HE HAD TO PASS RIGHT BY THE CURB AREA JUST NORTH OF THE ROCKINGHAM GATE AND WHAT HE NOTICED WHEN HE PULLED TO THAT AREA THAT WAS RIGHT IN HIS FIELD OF VIEW IS THAT THERE WAS NO CAR PARKED THERE, NO WHITE FORD BRONCO, AND IT WAS 10:39.THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT. WE WILL COME BACK TO THAT AGAIN.HE LOOKED DOWN THE DRIVEWAY AND HE SAW THAT THAT LOOKED LIKE A TIGHTER TURN EVEN THAN ASHFORD, SO HE BACKED THE LIMOUSINE UP ROCKINGHAM AVENUE AND MADE A LEFT TURN ONTO THE ASHFORD STREET AND PULLED RIGHT UP TO THE ASHFORD GATE.WHEN I SAY HE PULLED RIGHT UP TO THE ASHFORD GATE, ON THIS PHOTOGRAPH YOU SEE THE ASHFORD GATE OF THE DEFENDANT'S RESIDENCE.

AT THAT POINT -- AT THAT POINT HE DECIDED TO GO AND RING THE BUZZER.I WANTED TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING ELSE ON THIS SO YOU WILL KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT WHEN I SAY RING THE BUZZER.I'M GESTURING WITH THIS RED LIGHT. YOU CAN SEE RIGHT HERE, THAT IS THE CALL BOX, (INDICATING), WHERE HE WILL BE PRESSING THE BUZZER, AND IT RINGS INSIDE THE HOUSE. THE PERSON INSIDE CAN THEN PRESS A BUTTON TO OPEN THE GATE.AT 10:40 HE BEGAN TO RING THE BUZZER. HE COULD HEAR IT SOUND, BUT THERE WAS NO ANSWER. THERE WERE LIGHTS ON IN THE UPSTAIRS. ONE LIGHT ON UPSTAIRS. THERE WERE NO LIGHTS ON DOWNSTAIRS.IT SEEMED TO HIM LIKE NO ONE WAS HOME AND HE WAS A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT THAT, SO HE DECIDED TO PAGE HIS BOSS AND FIND OUT IF PERHAPS THE PLANS HAD CHANGED.AT 10:43 HE PAGED HIS BOSS. HE WAS THEN WORRIED THAT PERHAPS THE PAGE DIDN'T GO THROUGH, SO AT 10:49 HE CALLED HIS BOSS AT HOME, BUT THERE WAS NO ANSWER.HE THEN GOT OUT AND PUSHED THE BUZZER AT THE ASHFORD GATE A FEW MORE TIMES. STILL GOT NO ANSWER.NOW, DURING THIS PERIOD OF TIME KATO IS STILL IN HIS ROOM ON THE PHONE WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND RACHEL. NOW, WHAT I HAVEN'T EXPLAINED TO YOU YET, THIS AREA HERE SHOWN, (INDICATING), THIS IS THE SOUTHERN BORDER OF THE DEFENDANT'S PROPERTY. THIS IS A WALKWAY HERE, BUT IT IS NOT LIKE A WALK, IT IS VERY NARROW AND IT IS VERY DARK, JUST A FEW FEET WIDE. IT IS COVERED WITH LEAVES AND IT HAS THE SHRUBBERY THAT IS INDICATED HERE IS ACTUALLY FROM THE NEIGHBOR'S YARD AND THERE IS A CHAINLINK FENCE AND THE SHRUBBERY IS RIGHT UP AGAINST IT AND IT OVERHANGS THE WALK TO MAKE IT VERY DARK.HERE YOU CAN SEE WHAT IS INDICATED AS AN AIR CONDITIONER, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN ALL READ IT, BUT THAT IS WHAT IS WRITTEN HERE, THIS LITTLE BLACK BOX HERE. THIS AIR CONDITIONER ACTUALLY HANGS OVER THE WALKWAY QUITE A BIT. IT IS AN AIR CONDITIONER THAT IS SET INTO KATO'S WALL, SO YOU CAN SEE THE AIR CONDITIONER ON THE INSIDE AND THEN IT HANGS OUTSIDE THE WALL, OUTSIDE THE HOUSE OVER THAT WALKWAY, SO THAT THIS WALL OF KATO'S ROOM FACES ONTO THE SOUTH WALKWAY.THERE IS NO ENTRY OR EXIT THERE. HE CAN'T GO OUT THAT WAY. IF HE WANTS TO EXIT HIS ROOM HE HAS TO EXIT THROUGH THE DOORS THAT ARE RIGHT HERE, LIKE SHUTTERED DOORS, LIKE SHUTTERS, DOOR-LIKE SHUTTERS, AND HE GOES OUT THROUGH THOSE SHUTTERED DOORS TO THE POOL AREA AND THAT IS HOW HE EXITS.SO ON THAT NIGHT HE IS ON THE PHONE WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND RACHEL.BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICTATTORNEYS.)

THIS IS A SHOT TAKEN DURING THE DAYTIME.AT 10:45 KATO IS TALKING TO HIS GIRLFRIEND RACHEL WHEN SUDDENLY HE HEARD ON THE WALL WHERE THE AIR CONDITIONER WAS THREE LOUD THUMPS. THE THUMPS WERE SO LOUD THAT A PICTURE ON THAT WALL ACTUALLY MOVED. KATO WAS ALARMED. HE ASKED RACHEL, ""HAVE WE HAD AN EARTHQUAKE?"" WHEN SHE SAID SHE HADN'T FELT ANY, HE BECAME EVEN MORE ALARMED AND THEN HE WONDERED IF THERE MIGHT BE A PROWLER, SOMEBODY TRYING TO BREAK IN, BECAUSE IF IT WASN'T AN EARTHQUAKE, THAT IS WHAT IT HAD TO BE.HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE SOUND HE HAD HEARD. HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT THOSE THUMPING NOISES AND SO HE DECIDED THAT EVEN THOUGH HE WAS AFRAID AND IT WAS LATE AT NIGHT AND DARK HE SHOULD GO AND SEE WHAT THE CAUSES OF THOSE NOISES MIGHT BE.A FEW MINUTES LATER HE HUNG UP WITH RACHEL AND WENT OUT OF HIS ROOM TO GO AND LOOK.

#MS. CLARK: ,"HE WALKED OUT OF THOSE SHUTTERED DOORS AND OUT THROUGH THE POOL AREA COMING OUT ONTO THE SIDE DOOR THAT BORDERS ASHFORD STREET.WHEN HE CAME OUT TO THAT SIDE YARD HE SAW THE LIMOUSINE THAT WAS PULLED UP TO THE ASHFORD GATE, BUT HE FIGURED THAT THE DEFENDANT HAD ALREADY MADE CONTACT WITH HIM, WAS ABOUT TO LET HIM IN ANYWAY AND DIDN'T PAY ANY FURTHER ATTENTION, BECAUSE HE WAS VERY DISTRACTED BY WHAT THE CAUSE OF THOSE NOISES MIGHT BE.NOW, WITH HIM HE HAD A LITTLE DIM FLASHLIGHT THAT HE WAS GOING TO USE TO TRY AND SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON BACK THERE IN THE DARK.IN THE MEANTIME, JUST BEFORE KATO CAME OUT ONTO THE SIDE YARD, ALLAN PARK WAS STANDING AT THE ASHFORD GATE RINGING THE BUZZER, STILL GETTING NO ANSWER.FINALLY HE HEARD THE CAR PHONE RINGING INSIDE HIS CAR AND IT WAS 10:52. HE HAD STILL RECEIVED NO ANSWER TO THE BUZZING AT THE ASHFORD GATE, GOT BACK INTO THE CAR AND SPOKE TO HIS BOSS, TELLING HIS BOSS ""I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IS HOME. WHAT SHALL I DO?"" HIS BOSS TOLD HIM TO WAIT A LITTLE LONGER.AND WHEN HE HAD BEEN SPEAKING TO HIS BOSS FOR THREE MINUTES HE SAW KATO COMING OUT THE SIDE YARD WITH HIS LITTLE FLASHLIGHT. ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY SEEING KATO IN THE SIDE YARD, HE SAW A PERSON SIX FOOT TALL, 200 POUNDS, WEARING ALL DARK CLOTHING, AFRICAN AMERICAN, WALK QUICKLY UP THE DRIVEWAY AND INTO THE FRONT DOOR ENTRANCE.IMMEDIATELY AS THAT PERSON ENTERED THE HOUSE THE DOWNSTAIRS LIGHTS WENT ON. ALLAN PARK HUNG UP THE PHONE AND WALKED OVER TO THE ASHFORD GATE AND BUZZED AGAIN. THIS TIME HE GOT AN ANSWER AND THE DEFENDANT SAID -- A VOICE SAID -- THAT ALLAN COULD RECOGNIZE AS THE DEFENDANT'S, THE DEFENDANT SAID, ""SORRY, I OVERSLEPT. I JUST GOT OUT OF THE SHOWER. I WILL BE DOWN IN ONE MINUTE.""NOW, KATO WHO WAS DISTRACTED BY THE POSSIBILITY OF A PROWLER, WASN'T LOOKING TO SEE IF ANYONE WAS COMING AND DIDN'T SEE, AND ALTHOUGH ALLAN PARK COULD NOT SEE WELL ENOUGH AT THE TIME THE PERSON ENTERED THE HOUSE TO IDENTIFY WHO IT WAS, CLEARLY THAT WAS THE DEFENDANT.NOW, WHILE ALLAN WAS STANDING AT THE GATE SPEAKING TO THE DEFENDANT ON THE INTERCOM, KATO DECIDED TO WALK AROUND TO THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE GARAGE AND HE WAS GOING TO ATTEMPT TO GO DOWN THAT NARROW WALKWAY TO SEE WHAT HAD HAPPENED, BUT WHEN HE ACTUALLY GOT BACK TO THIS CORNER OF THE GARAGE WITH THIS LITTLE DIM FLASHLIGHT, IT WAS VERY DARK AND HE WAS SCARED SO HE DECIDED NOT DO AND HE CAME BACK AROUND.WHEN HE CAME BACK AROUND HE REALIZED THAT THE LIMO DRIVER WAS STILL OUTSIDE THE GATE, SO EVEN THOUGH THE DEFENDANT HAD SPOKEN TO HIM AND SAID HE WAS COMING DOWN, HE DID NOT OPEN THE GATE FOR HIM.KATO HAD TO GO AND OPEN THE GATE. HE OPENED THE GATE AND HE LET HIM PULL IN.AS SOON AS ALLAN PARK PULLED THE LIMOUSINE INTO THE DRIVEWAY, KATO, WHO WAS STILL VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE SOUNDS, STARTED TALKING TO HIM, TELLING HIM HE HAD HEARD THE THUMPS ON HIS WALL, HIS PICTURE MOVED, HE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A PROWLER OR MAYBE IT WAS AN EARTHQUAKE, HAD ALLAN FELT AN EARTHQUAKE.ALLEN SAID, ""NO, I HAVEN'T."" KATO WAS VERY NERVOUS, BUT NOW WITH ALLAN PULLED INTO THE DRIVEWAY AND INSIDE THE GROUNDS, HE FELT A LITTLE SAFER, SO KATO DECIDED TO GO BACK TO THE AREA AND TRY AND CHECK OUT THE SOUNDS AND WHAT HAD CAUSED THEM.WHEN HE WENT BACK TO THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE GARAGE, HE WENT THROUGH A FIRST GATE THAT BASICALLY YOU JUST LIFT AND PUSH AGAINST THE WALL, IT IS NOT A LOCKING GATE, WENT UP AS FAR AS A SECOND GATE, BUT COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING. IT WAS STILL DARK, THE FLASHLIGHT WAS VERY DIM AND HE DECIDED TO COME BACK. HE WAS STILL TOO AFRAID TO GO BACK THERE BY HIMSELF.KATO CAME BACK OUT AROUND THE GARAGE, AND WHEN HE CAME OUT HE SAW THAT THE DEFENDANT HAD COME OUT OF THE HOUSE BY THAT TIME.THE DEFENDANT WAS NOW WEARING A LIGHT BLUE DENIM SHIRT AND LIGHT BLUE DENIM JEANS.AS HE CAME OUT KATO ALSO NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A SMALL DARK BAG PLACED NEAR WHERE THE ROLLS ROYCE -- EXCUSE ME -- THE BENTLEY WAS PARKED. REMEMBER I TOLD YOU THE DEFENDANT PARKED HIS BENTLEY THIS WAY, (INDICATING), FACING OUT TOWARD ROCKINGHAM. HE COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS A SMALL DARK BAG ON THE GRASS NEAR THAT BENTLEY.WHILE THEY WERE -- IT WAS ALLAN PARK AND KATO WHO WERE LOADING ALL OF THE BAGS INTO THE LIMOUSINE, AND WHILE THEY WERE LOADING THE BAGS INTO THE LIMOUSINE KATO SPOKE AGAIN OF THE THUMPS THAT HE HAD HEARD, AND BEING WORRIED THAT IT WAS A PROWLER, THINKING IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN EARTHQUAKE, HOPING IT WAS AN EARTHQUAKE, SO HE ASKED THE DEFENDANT FOR A BETTER FLASHLIGHT SO HE COULD GO AROUND TO THE BACK AREA AND CHECK OUT THE SOURCE OF THOSE SOUNDS AGAIN.HE AND THE DEFENDANT THEN WALKED INTO THE HOUSE VERY BRIEFLY, BUT THEN THE DEFENDANT SAID, ""OH, IT IS LATE, I GOT TO GO"" AND CAME BACK OUT.WHILE THEY WERE LOADING THE BAGS KATO OFFERED TO GO AND GET THAT SMALL DARK BAG ON THE GRASS AND PUT IT IN THE CAR FOR THE DEFENDANT. UNLIKE ANY OF THE OTHER BAGS, THE DEFENDANT SAID, ""NO, NO, NO, I WILL GO GET THEM."" HE WENT AND GOT THE BAG. THE DEFENDANT GOT THE BAG, AND PUT IT INTO THE CAR.NOW, THE DEFENDANT DID NOT GIVE KATO A BETTER FLASHLIGHT, AND WHEN HE LEFT, ALTHOUGH KATO STILL SEEMED CONCERNED ABOUT THE THUMPS, THE DEFENDANT SEEMED RELATIVELY UNCONCERNED. HE GOT INTO THE LIMOUSINE AND THEY LEFT FOR THE AIRPORT AT APPROXIMATELY 11:15.NOW, LET ME BACK UP FOR A MINUTE.JUST BEFORE HE LEFT, THE DEFENDANT ASKED KATO TO SET THE ALARM. KATO SAID HE DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT. HE HAD NEVER SET THE ALARM BEFORE. HE DIDN'T KNOW THE CODE AND HE FELT VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY. HE TOLD THE DEFENDANT, ""NO, I REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.""THE DEFENDANT THEN LEFT. THEY TOOK OUT -- THEY LEFT AT THE ROCKINGHAM GATE AT 11:15.KATO WENT BACK TO HIS ROOM TO CALL BACK HIS GIRLFRIEND, RACHEL FERRARA, AS HE PROMISED TO DO.ON THE WAY TO THE AIRPORT THE DEFENDANT REPEATEDLY COMPLAINED OF BEING HOT. ALLAN PARK COULD SEE THAT HE WAS SWEATING AND HE ROLLED DOWN THE WINDOWS AND TURNED ON THE AIR CONDITIONER. THE TEMPERATURE THAT NIGHT WAS 63 DEGREES.DURING THAT DRIVE TO THE AIRPORT ALLAN COULD SEE THAT THE DEFENDANT WAS MOVING AROUND WITH HIS BAGS IN THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT, ALTHOUGH HE COULDN'T SEE EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS DOING.THEY ARRIVED AT THE AIRPORT AT 11:30 AND THAT SMALL DARK BAG THAT THE DEFENDANT INSISTED ON PUTTING IN THE CAR HIMSELF WAS NEVER SEEN AGAIN AFTER THE DEFENDANT LEFT FOR CHICAGO.NOW, DURING THE TIME THE DEFENDANT WAS DRIVING TO THE AIRPORT KATO WAS ON THE PHONE AGAIN WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND RACHEL. DURING THAT PHONE CALL THERE WAS A CALL WAITING INTERRUPTION. THE CALL WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE DEFENDANT. THE DEFENDANT TOLD HIM, ""I NEED YOU TO SET THE ALARM. I FORGOT TO SET THE ALARM."" HE HAD TO GIVE KATO THE SECURITY CODE AND TELL HIM WHERE TO GO AND SET THE ALARM. THERE WAS A KEY PAD OUTSIDE THE FRONT ENTRANCE AT THE FRONT DOOR.NOW, IN THE SIX MONTHS THAT KATO HAD BEEN LIVING THERE, THE DEFENDANT HAD NEVER ASKED HIM TO SET THE ALARM BEFORE, HAD NEVER HAD TO GIVE HIM THE SECURITY CODE BEFORE. THIS WAS THE VERY FIRST TIME THAT HAD EVER HAPPENED.NOW, AT THIS POINT WE KNOW THE FOLLOWING:WE TALKED TO YOU ABOUT THE TIMING AGAIN.

THEY COULDN'T FIND ANY OPINION KEYS FOR IT, THEY COULDN'T GET INTO IT, SO IT WAS TOWED IN A LOCKED CONDITION TO THE PRINT SHED, WHICH IS AN AREA WHERE THE POLICE KEEP LARGE ITEMS THAT NEED TO BE FINGERPRINTED, WHERE THEY CAN KEEP IT LOCKED UP.THEY TOWED IT TO THE PRINT SHED AND DID NOT OPEN IT UNTIL THE 14TH WHEN THEY OPENED IT BY USE OF A SLIMJIM.YOU WILL PROBABLY HEAR SOME DISCUSSION OF THINGS THAT OCCURRED WITH THAT BRONCO AFTER THE 15TH AND THEY MAY BE INTERESTING, BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE EVIDENCE THAT WAS RECOVERED ON THE 14TH.AND A SEARCH FOR BLOOD WAS CONDUCTED OF THAT BRONCO ON JUNE THE 14TH. THOSE ITEMS WERE RECOVERED. THE BLOOD WAS COLLECTED AND IT WAS ANALYZED AND THOSE ITEMS THAT WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT TODAY THAT WERE ANALYZED WERE RECOVERED FROM THE BRONCO ON JUNE THE 14TH.NOW, ALL OF THE ITEMS I HAVE JUST SHOWN YOU WERE COLLECTED AND SUBMITTED FOR EXAMINATION AND ANALYSIS, AND WHAT YOU HAVE HERE IS A TRAIL OF BLOOD FROM BUNDY DRIVE TO ROCKINGHAM AVENUE AND INTO THE DEFENDANT'S VERY BEDROOM LINKED BY THE DEFENDANT'S WHITE FORD BRONCO.I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO THE DETAILS RIGHT NOW WITH YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ABOUT THE MANNER IN WHICH EVIDENCE WAS COLLECTED OR THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS ALL ANALYZED, WE HAVE EXPERTS FOR THAT, BUT I DO WANT TO MAKE SOME GENERAL COMMENTS IN ORDER TO POINT OUT A FEW THINGS RIGHT NOW JUST TO DISPEL ANY MISCONCEPTION ANYONE MIGHT HAVE ABOUT EVIDENCE COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS.FIRST OF ALL, COLLECTING BLOOD STAINS IS A VERY SIMPLE THING, YOU OR I COULD DO IT, AND I TELL YOU THIS BECAUSE I'M NOT THAT GOOD MECHANICALLY OR SCIENTIFICALLY, BUT EVEN I COULD DO IT.WHAT YOU DO IS YOU TAKE A VERY SMALL SQUARE OF COTTON AND YOU PUT DISTILLED WATER ON IT AND YOU SOAK UP THE STAIN. THERE IS NO MAGIC. ANYONE CAN DO IT. IT IS JUST LIKE YOU WOULD GO AND SOAK UP A SPILL IN YOUR KITCHEN; NOT VERY DIFFERENT.NOW, MANY LABORATORIES OR MANY POLICE AGENCIES USE LAB TECHNICIANS FOR THAT, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE A BACHELOR'S OF SCIENCE OR ANY PARTICULAR DEGREE OF CRIMINALISTICS OR FORENSICS.FORENSICS IS A SCIENCE OF CRIME ANALYSIS OR INVESTIGATION. MANY OF THEM DON'T USE ANYONE FOR THAT, BUT LAPD DOES. LAPD USES CRIMINALISTS WHO ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BACHELOR OF SCIENCE DEGREES IN FORENSIC SCIENCE, THE SCIENCE OF CRIME SCENE ANALYSIS, SO THEY ACTUALLY USE PEOPLE WHO ARE OVERQUALIFIED FOR THE JOB.AN ISSUE IN THIS CASE WILL BE THE TESTIMONY OF THE CORONER. I KNOW SOME OF US HAVE SEEN ANYWAY QUINCY, JACK KLUGMAN ON TELEVISION. HE GOES OUT TO INVESTIGATE THE CRIME AND HE FINDS OUT WHO DID IT, AND IN THE GENERAL COURSE OF THINGS, ALTHOUGH THERE IS A CORONER'S INVESTIGATOR, THAT INVESTIGATOR IS JUST RESPONSIBLE FOR COLLECTING THE BODY FROM THE SCENE AND GETTING IT TO THE CORONER'S OFFICE INTACT.WHAT THE CORONER DOES IS THE CORONER LOOKS AT THE BODY TO DETERMINE CAUSE OF DEATH.LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I CAN GUARANTEE YOU ONE THING IN THIS TRIAL, THERE WILL BE NO DISPUTE AS TO CAUSE OF DEATH. NO ONE WILL ARGUE ABOUT WHAT THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS FOR RON GOLDMAN AND NICOLE BROWN.THE ISSUE THAT WILL BE RAISED IS THE TIME OF DEATH. NOW, WHAT CAN A CORONER DO FOR YOU WITH RESPECT TO TIME OF DEATH? THE CORONER CAN NEVER REALLY BE THAT PRECISE. A CORONER CAN TELL YOU JUST BASED ON HIS EXAMINATION OF THE BODY, CAN USUALLY BRING IT DOWN TO A RANGE OF WITHIN THREE HOURS, BETWEEN 9:00 AND MIDNIGHT, BETWEEN MIDNIGHT AND 3:00, BUT IF YOU WANT TO PINPOINT THE TIME TO WITHIN A MINUTE, TEN MINUTES, A HALF HOUR OR EVEN AN HOUR OR TWO HOURS, A CORONER SOLELY BY HIS EXAMINATION OF THE BODY CANNOT DO IT.WE ALWAYS HAVE TO -- AND THAT IS TRUE IN ANY CASE, IN ANY CASE.WE ALWAYS HAVE TO RELY ON THE TESTIMONY OF OTHER WITNESSES, WITNESSES WHO WILL TELL YOU WHEN THE VICTIMS MADE A PHONE CALL OR WHEN THEY HEARD THE VICTIM LEAVING THE HOUSE OR WHEN THEY LAST SAW THE VICTIM.DOGS BARKING, THE KIND OF EVIDENCE I JUST TALKED TO YOU ABOUT, IS OFTEN WHAT IS USED IF YOU WANT TO TRY AND REALLY PINPOINT THE TIME BECAUSE THE CORONER CANNOT PINPOINT IT TO WITHIN MINUTES OR EVEN AN HOUR REALLY INY ANY CASE.NOW, BEFORE I GET INTO THE ANALYSIS OF EVIDENCE, I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT SCIENTISTS AND CRIMINALISTS LOOK FOR NOWADAYS WHEN THEY EXAMINE THE EVIDENCE. WE'VE MADE TREMENDOUS STRIDES IN MANY AREAS.IN GENERAL, IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE CRIMES, THE POLICE HAVE TO STAY AT LEAST ONE STEP AHEAD OF THE CRIMINALS. THAT MEANS THAT THEY HAVE TO LOOK FOR EVIDENCE IN PLACES AND IN WAYS THAT CRIMINALS WILL NOT HAVE THOUGHT OF.FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT YOU COULD MATCH FINGERPRINTS, CRIMINALS WORE GLOVES. WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT A BULLET REMOVED FROM THE BODY OF A VICTIM COULD BE MATCHED TO THE GUN THAT FIRED THE BULLET, THEY STARTED TO DISPOSE OF WEAPONS OR TO USE WEAPONS THAT COULD BE EASILY DISPOSED OF OTHER THAN GUNS, AND NOWADAYS IT IS VERY COMMON TO FIND CASES WHERE NO MURDER WEAPON IS RECOVERED BECAUSE THEY ARE SMART ENOUGH TO GET RID OF THOSE WEAPONS.SO NOT ALL CRIMINALS FIGURED THIS OUT, BUT THE SMART ONES DID, SO WE LOOK AT BLOOD, FOR EXAMPLE. WE TEST IT FOR DNA. WE LOOK AT HAIR AND FIBER. WE EXAMINE IT MICROSCOPICALLY COMPARING IT TO THE VICTIMS AND TO THE SUSPECTS TO SEE IF WE CAN EXCLUDE THEM OR IF IT IS CONSISTENT WITH THEM.NOW, IN PARTICULAR, THE VALUE OF HAIR AND FIBER IS A VERY UNIQUE THING. THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT THROUGH YOUR DAILY LIFE YOU WALK AROUND, YOU SHED HAIR, YOU SHED FIBER, YOU PICK UP HAIR, YOU PICK UP FIBER, AND YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF IT, IT GOES UNNOTICED, AND IT IS AN INVOLUNTARY THING AND IT HAPPENS CONSTANTLY THROUGH THE DAY. THERE IS A VERY FANCY TERM FOR THIS AND IT IS CALLED THE LOCAR EXCHANGE PRINCIPLE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT BECAUSE ALL IT REALLY SAYS IS WHEN YOU GO INTO A PLACE THE ENVIRONMENT AFFECTS YOU AND YOU AFFECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND THAT IS JUST WHAT I SAID. YOU LEAVE HAIR AND FIBERS AND YOU PICK UP HAIR AND FIBERS.SAY, FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU HAVE A RED COUCH, AN EXPERT CAN LOOK AT YOUR CLOTHING AND FIND THE RED FIBERS AND LOOK AT THEM UNDER A MICROSCOPE AND SAY, FIRST OF ALL, YOU ARE NEAR SOMETHING WITH RED FIBERS, AND IF HE HAS ACCESS WITH THAT COUCH, CAN EXAMINE IT AND SEE THAT THEY ARE CONSISTENT, THAT IS, THAT THEY COULD HAVE HAD THE SAME SOURCE.WHAT THE VALUE OF THIS IS THAT IT SHOWS CONTACT, IT SHOWS WHERE ITEMS OF EVIDENCE MIGHT HAVE BEEN, IT SHOWS WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN A GIVEN LOCATION AND WHO CAME INTO CONTACT WITH WHO.BECAUSE YOU FIND HAIR AND FIBER SO OFTEN IN A CRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE SHEDDING GOES UNNOTICED, THIS CAN BE A VERY GREAT VALUE IN SOLVING CRIMES.SO EVERY CRIME SCENE AND EVERY PIECE OF EVIDENCE HAS VALUE IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO HELP YOU SOLVE THE CASE.NOW, WITH RESPECT TO BLOOD EVIDENCE, AS YOU KNOW, WE'VE MADE ENORMOUS STRIDES. WE HAVE ADVANCED OUR ABILITY TO EXTRACT INFORMATION FROM BLOOD WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF DNA TESTING. THIS ALLOWS US TO BE FAR MORE PRECISE IN PINPOINTING THE POSSIBLE SOURCE OF A BLOOD STAIN.AND WE CAN ALSO HAVE THEN THE EXPERTS TELL US HOW RARE IT IS THAT YOU HAVE A BLOOD STAIN MATCHED TO THE TYPE OF A PARTICULAR PERSON. I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO THE DETAILS OF ALL THAT TESTING, I'M GOING TO LET THE EXPERTS TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT WHEN THEY COME IN AND TESTIFY, BUT THEY WILL. THEY WILL COME IN AND TELL YOU ABOUT ALL OF THE PROCESSES AND THEY WILL EXPLAIN HOW RARE IT IS TO FIND A MATCH BETWEEN A BLOOD SPOT IN A PLACE AND A PARTICULAR PERSON.NOW, THE DEFENSE IS GOING TO SPEAK TO YOU AT LENGTH ABOUT CONTAMINATION AND ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT COULD ENSUE IN THE TESTING, BUT I WILL SIMPLY SAY THIS AT THIS POINT:THERE ARE SAFEGUARDS BUILT INTO THE DNA TESTS THAT YOU WILL HEAR ABOUT AND THESE SAFEGUARDS WILL SHOW WHEN PROBLEMS OCCUR. THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY DNA TESTING IS SO RELIABLE.AND YOU WILL SEE THAT IN THIS CASE WE HAVE MANY BLOOD STAINS, AS YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN, NOT JUST ONE. YOU MIGHT QUESTION IT IF ONLY ONE OF MANY BLOOD STAINS CAME BACK TO A SUSPECT, BUT WHEN ONE AFTER ANOTHER AFTER ANOTHER AFTER ANOTHER MATCHES THE SAME PERSON, THEN YOU REALIZE THAT THE TESTING IS ACCURATE, THAT IT WORKS, AND THAT IF THERE WAS CONTAMINATION IT WOULDN'T KEEP COMING BACK TO ONE PERSON; IT JUST WOULDN'T COME BACK AT ALL.AND ALTHOUGH WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SCIENCE, AND SOMETIMES JUST SAYING THAT WORD CAN MAKE US UNCOMFORTABLE, ALL YOU ARE GOING TO NEED IS COMMON SENSE AND LOGIC TO FOLLOW THIS EVIDENCE. THAT IS ALL YOU WILL NEED.NOW, DNA TESTING IS NOT ONLY USED TO SOLVE CRIMES, IT HAS MANY OTHER PURPOSES AS WELL. SOME OF YOU TALKED ABOUT JURASSIC PARK AND THEY USED DNA TO MAKE DINOSAURS, BUT THERE ARE OTHER MORE COMMON USES FOR IT AS WELL.FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS USED IN AMNIOCENTESIS. WE TALKED ABOUT THAT IN YOUR QUESTIONNAIRE AND WE TALKED TO YOU DURING YOUR VOIR DIRE PROCESS, IF YOU RECALL. THAT IS THE PROCESS WHERE YOU DETERMINE WHETHER A FETUS MAY HAVE A GENETIC DEFECT. MOST OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THAT EITHER BY FIRST OR SECONDHAND EXPERIENCE.AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT PROCESS IS THAT FLUID IS EXTRACTED FROM THE MOTHER'S STOMACH, FROM THE SAC, AND THAT IS AMNIOTIC FLUID, THAT IS THE FLUID THAT THE BABY FLOATS IN TO PROTECT IT, THEY ANALYZE THAT FLUID TO SEE IF THE BABY HAS A GENETIC DEFECT.NOW, THAT PROCEDURE HAS MANY OF THE SAME PROBLEMS --

#MS. CLARK: ,"NOW, THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THE AMNIOCENTESIS PROCEDURE HAS MANY OF THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT CRIME SCENE ANALYSIS DOES AND THOSE PROBLEMS ARE THAT YOU HAVE LIMITATIONS IN QUANTITY. THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH YOU CAN GET, RIGHT? IF YOU GO TO A CRIME SCENE, YOU COLLECT THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU FIND AND YOU ARE LIMITED BY THAT.THE SAME THING IS TRUE OF THE AMNIOCENTESIS. FIRST OF ALL, YOU CAN'T WITHDRAW TOO MUCH FLUID OR IT WILL ENDANGER THE BABY, NOT TO MENTION IT IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE FOR THE MOTHER. YOU ARE LIMITED IN QUANTITY THEN IN BOTH SITUATIONS.YOU ALSO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH A MIXTURE. BY THAT I MEAN AT A CRIME SCENE YOU OFTEN HAVE A MIXTURE OF THE VICTIM'S BLOOD, EITHER WITH EACH OTHER OR WITH THE DEFENDANT, AND THAT MEANS THAT THEY HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO SEPARATE THEM OUT, WHO COULD BE THE SOURCE OF THIS AND WHAT POSSIBLE MIXTURE YOU HAVE.THAT IS A VERY SIMILAR PROBLEM TO THE AMNIOCENTESIS WHERE YOU MIGHT PICK UP CELLS FROM THE MOTHER AND THEN YOU ARE ANALYZING FOR THE GENETIC MAKE-UP OF THE MOTHER INSTEAD OF THE BABY, SO THEY HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO SEPARATE THAT OUT IN CASE IT HAPPENS, SO YOU HAVE VERY SIMILAR SITUATIONS.ANOTHER SITUATION THAT IS SIMILAR TO CRIME SCENE ANALYSIS IS IDENTIFICATION OF THE WAR DEAD. ONE OF THE TRAGIC ASPECTS OF DYING IN A WAR IS THAT SOMETIMES WE ARE LEFT WITH NOTHING BUT BODY PARTS AND WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHOSE THEY ARE.IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH THE IDENTITY THEY WILL TAKE THAT BODY PART, EXTRACT THE DNA AND DETERMINE IF IT MATCHES TO -- THAT GOES INTO A PARENTAL THING. YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE PARENTS AND THEN YOU CAN TELL BASED UPON WHAT THE PERSON'S MAKE-UP IS WHETHER THIS WAS THEIR CHILD. THAT IS ONE WAY OF DOING IT. IT IS CALLED PATERNITY MATCH.DNA TESTING CAN DO THAT. NOW, OBVIOUSLY THE BODY PARTS, TISSUES OR ORGANS THAT ARE FOUND IN WAR DEAD ARE FOUND OUT IN JUNGLES, IN DESERTS, THEY ARE FOUND IN TERRIBLE PLACES WHERE THERE IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF DETERIORATION AND IT IS DIFFICULT, THE SAME WAY AS IN A CRIME SCENE, BECAUSE IN A CRIME SCENE IT IS MESSY AND DIRTY, THERE IS GOING TO BE A STREET, A SIDEWALK, A HOUSE, A CAR. THAT IS NOT A LABORATORY SITUATION.WELL, IT IS THE SAME THING WITH THE WAR DEAD. YOU HAVE KIND OF UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS THAT ARE GOING TO DETERIORATE A SAMPLE VERY RAPIDLY, AND SO YOU HAVE A SIMILAR PROBLEM WITH NON-CRIMINAL CRIME SCENE USES AS DO YOU WITH CRIME SCENE USES AND YET DNA HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN IDENTIFYING THE WAR DEAD.ANOTHER WAY THAT DNA HAS BEEN USED THAT IS NOT IN CRIME SCENE ANALYSIS IS IN IDENTIFYING OLD REMAINS. BY THAT I MEAN SKELETONS. THEY EXTRACT THE DNA FROM SKELETONS TO DETERMINE THE IDENTITY OF THE PEOPLE THAT ONCE THOSE SKELETONS WERE, AND THEY DID THAT RECENTLY TO IDENTIFY THE RUSSIAN ROYAL FAMILY THAT LIVED BACK IN 1917.SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THE DNA TESTING PROCEDURES IS A VERY POWERFUL TOOL THAT IS USEFUL IN MANY, MANY WAYS, NOT JUST IN CRIME SCENE ANALYSIS, BUT IN MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS AND IN IDENTIFICATIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY IN OTHER AREAS.NOW, THERE ARE A COUPLE OF APPROACHES TO DNA TESTING THAT CAN BE TAKEN. THE FIRST ONE -- YOU ARE GOING TO HEAR THESE TERMS A LOT SO I'M GOING TO START YOU TODAY -- IS RFLP. THAT STANDS FOR RESTRICTION FRAGMENT LENGTH POLYMORPHISM AND ALL YOU HAVE TO KNOW IS RFLP FOR NOW.THE EXPERTS WILL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING TO YOU AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME.THAT IS A VERY POWERFUL TOOL USED TO PINPOINT THE IDENTITY OF THE PERSON WHO LEFT BLOOD OR HAIR OR FIBER -- EXCUSE ME -- BLOOD OR HAIR OR BODILY FLUID IN AN AREA, VERY POWERFUL TOOL.ANOTHER DNA TEST, NOT QUITE AS POWERFUL BUT STILL MORE POWERFUL THAN WE USED TO HAVE, IS CALLED PCR, POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION. IN THAT FORM OF TESTING YOU CAN TAKE MUCH SMALLER BITS OF DNA AND AMPLIFY THEM. ACTUALLY YOU JUST MULTIPLY THEM LIKE XEROXING AND YOU MAKE IT LARGE ENOUGH SO THAT YOU CAN TEST IT AND THAT HAS BEEN A VERY, VERY IMPORTANT FULL TOOL AS WELL IN ANALYZING AND DETERMINING THE SOURCE OF A STAIN OR BODILY FLUID THAT YOU FIND AT A CRIME SCENE.REGARDLESS OF THE METHOD USED, WHETHER IT IS RFLP OR PCR, THEY ARE BOTH DNA TESTING AND THE TESTS ARE REALLY TESTS OF EXCLUSION. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? THAT MEANS THAT WHEN YOU CONDUCT THESE TESTS, THE EFFORT IS TO EXCLUDE. YOU ANALYZE THE DNA AND YOU SAY CAN I EXCLUDE THE SUSPECT? CAN I RULE HIM OUT? IS THERE ANYTHING HERE INCONSISTENT WITH THE SUSPECT OR THE VICTIMS, DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT?AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WAS DONE IN THIS CASE WITH EVERY PIECE OF EVIDENCE COLLECTED. THE EFFORT WAS TO EXCLUDE THE DEFENDANT AND TO EXCLUDE THE VICTIMS. THAT WAS THE FOCUS AND THAT IS THE AIM OF DNA TESTING.IN THIS CASE WE ASKED THIS QUESTION OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. CAN THE DEFENDANT BE EXCLUDED? NO MATTER HOW HARD WE TRIED, OVER AND OVER THE SAMPLES WERE TESTED AND RETESTED AND TESTED AGAIN. OVER AND OVER AGAIN WE ASKED OURSELVES CAN THE DEFENDANT BE EXCLUDED? AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN THE ANSWER WAS NO, THE DEFENDANT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED.I WOULD NOW LIKE TO BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE FOR YOU ALL OF THE TEST RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS OF THE EVIDENCE THAT I HAVE JUST DESCRIBED AND I'M GOING TO START WITH THE HAIR AND FIBER.NOW, THE HAIR AND FIBER IS MICROSCOPIC ANALYSIS; IT IS NOT DNA. THIS IS THE COMPARISON OF HAIRS AND FIBERS FOUND ON VARIOUS ITEMS OF EVIDENCE AND IN LOCATIONS AT THE SCENE THAT WERE COMPARED TO THE DEFENDANT, THE VICTIMS AND VARIOUS OTHER ITEMS OF EVIDENCE. IT IS EASIER TO EXPLAIN TO YOU IF I ACTUALLY TELL YOU THE RESULTS.

IT WAS ALSO NECESSARY FOR US TO APOLOGIZE TO THE DEFENDANT, THE DEFENSE TEAM, THE PROSECUTION, THE REST OF THE MEDIA THAT IS DEPENDENT UPON COURT T.V., AND INDEED THE VIEWING PUBLIC ITSELF, FOR CAUSING THIS HEARING AND INTERRUPTING THIS PROCEEDING.IT WAS AN ERROR, A REGRETTABLE ERROR, A HIGHLY REGRETTABLE ERROR THAT WE BELIEVE WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN.IT HAPPENED, YOUR HONOR, AS A RESULT OF A SCAN OF THE CAMERA REACHING SUFFICIENTLY FAR AROUND TO CATCH THE ALTERNATE JUROR MOMENTARILY.THAT WAS AN ERROR WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN CAUGHT AND WASN'T. AGAINST OVER 30,000 HOURS OF COURT T.V. TIME WITHOUT A GLITCH, YOUR HONOR, THIS MOMENTARY BLOTCH IS A VERY BIG STAIN AND ONE THAT THE PRESIDENT OF COURT T.V. IS DEDICATED TO REMEDY AND DEDICATED TO PREVENTING FROM A REPEAT.THE RESPONSES THAT WERE MADE WHEN THIS WAS NOTICED, YOUR HONOR, WERE IMMEDIATE AND WERE TAKEN INSTINCTIVELY AND WITHOUT HESITATION. IMMEDIATELY THIS COURT WAS PUT ON NOTICE AND PROVIDED WITH A DUB OF THE MOMENT THAT CAPTURED THE ALTERNATE JUROR.IMMEDIATELY THE REST OF THE MEDIA WAS PUT ON NOTICE AND REQUESTED NOT TO REBROADCAST ANY PORTION OF THAT.NOW, THOSE RESPONSES DO NOT IN ANY WAY ERASE THAT ERROR, YOUR HONOR, BUT I HOPE THEY WILL REASSURE THE COURT OF THE INADVERTENCE OF THE ERROR AND OF THE INTEGRITY OF THE COURT T.V.

THE DIRECT LINK WAS NOT BETWEEN THE CAMERA OPERATOR AND THE PERSON WITH THE KILL SWITCH.AND BY THE TIME THE PERSON IN THE PRESS ROOM COULD COMMUNICATE IT TO THE WOMAN RUNNING THE KILL SWITCH, IT WAS TOO LATE. THAT CAN ALSO BE FIXED AND HAS BEEN FIXED, AS I UNDERSTAND IT, ALREADY THIS MORNING, SO THAT THE CAMERA OPERATOR IN THE COURTROOM WILL HAVE A DIRECT AUDIO LINK UP WITH THE PEOPLE IN THE KILL SWITCH ROOM WHO ARE SEPARATE FROM THE PRESS ROOM SO THAT INSTANTLY UPON NOTICING AN ERROR THEY CAN FIX IT.THE THIRD PROBLEM, WHICH ALSO IS BEING FIXED, IS THE WOMAN WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THE KILL SWITCH YESTERDAY EVIDENTLY HAD NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO VIEW THE COURTROOM AND WAS NOT AWARE THAT THERE WERE JURORS SITTING IN FRONT OF THE JURY BOX.

THE CAMERA SIMPLY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CAPTURE ANYTHING BELOW A CERTAIN POINT.AND ONE OF THE TECHNICIANS HAS DRAWN A DIAGRAM WHICH WE CAN SHOW TO THE COURT TO EXPLAIN HOW THAT CAN BE DONE SO THAT THERE IS NO CHANCE THAT THE CAMERA CANNOT CAPTURE IT ANY MORE THAN IT COULD SWING DOWN LOW ENOUGH TO CAPTURE ANYONE ELSE.

THE SAME ADMONITION APPLIED TO THEM -- THOSE WERE NOT FACTS -- THAT YOU KEPT AN OPEN MIND, BECAUSE YOU PROMISED TO DO THAT THROUGHOUT.WE STARTED THIS PROCESS OF TRIAL BACK ON SEPTEMBER 26, 1994. THAT WAS THE FIRST DAY WE ALL MET, WHEN YOU CAME DOWN TO THE JURY ROOM UP ON THE 11TH FLOOR, AND HERE WE ARE NOW SEVERAL MONTHS LATER IN THIS SEARCH FOR JUSTICE.YOU HEAR A LOT ABOUT THIS TALK ABOUT JUSTICE. I GUESS DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING SAID IT BEST WHEN HE SAID THAT INJUSTICE ANYWHERE IS A THREAT TO JUSTICE EVERYWHERE, AND SO WE ARE NOW EMBARKED UPON THIS SEARCH FOR JUSTICE, THIS SEARCH FOR TRUTH, THIS SEARCH FOR THE FACTS.EACH OF YOU MADE A NUMBER OF PROMISES IN THE COURSE OF THE VOIR DIRE EXAMINATION, WHICH IS BASICALLY UNPRECEDENTED AND DUE MAINLY TO THE LARGESSE OF JUDGE ITO IN UNDERSTANDING THE POSSIBILITY OF MEDIA TAINT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CASE.SO WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT YOU AT THIS POINT AND WE -- OF COURSE ALL SIDES ARE VERY, VERY PLEASED WITH THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE AGREED TO SERVE AS JURORS, TO GIVE US YOUR TIME, TO LEAVE YOUR LIVES, TO BE SEQUESTERED AS IT WERE. THAT IS A REMARKABLE SACRIFICE.ABRAHAM LINCOLN SAID IT BEST WHEN HE SAID THAT THE HIGHEST ACT OF CITIZENSHIP IS JURY SERVICE. AND YOU ARE EMBARKED UPON THAT JURY SERVICE, BUT IT DOESN'T STOP WITH JUST COMING DOWN AND TAKING NOTES. IT DOESN'T STOP WITH THE INCONVENIENCE OF BEING AWAY FROM YOUR FAMILIES. WHEN IT STOPS IS WHEN YOU, IF YOU CAN, RENDER A VERDICT IN THIS CASE AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT VERDICT REFLECTS THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE, A VERDICT RENDERED DEVOID OF SYMPATHY FOR OR PASSION AGAINST MR. SIMPSON OR ANY SIDE OF THIS CASE.YOU MADE THESE PROMISES AND BOTH SIDES ARE MINDFUL OF THOSE PROMISES AND WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE GOING TO KEEP THOSE PROMISES.CICERO SAID THAT HE WHO VIOLATES HIS OATH PROFANES THE DIVINITY OF FAITH ITSELF.AND OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT YOU WILL LIVE UP TO YOUR PROMISES AND BE FAIR AND KEEP AN OPEN MIND AND DECIDE THIS CASE NOT ON SPECULATION, NOT ON CONJECTURE, NOT ON SURMISE, BUT BASED UPON THE FACTS.YOU THEN AS JURORS ARE THE CONSCIENCE OF THIS COMMUNITY. YOUR VERDICTS SET THE STANDARDS OF WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE AND WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN IN THIS COMMUNITY. YOU HAVE THIS RARE OPPORTUNITY, IT SEEMS TO ME, TO BE A PARTICIPANT IN THIS SEARCH FOR JUSTICE AND FOR TRUTH, AND IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, HOPEFULLY BY APRIL OF THIS YEAR, I'M OPTIMISTIC STILL, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO RENDER PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT DECISION OF YOUR LIVES.AND SO WE WANT YOU TO KEEP YOUR MINDS OPEN AND FRESH SO THAT YOU CAN RENDER THAT DECISION IMPARTIALLY TO BOTH SIDES SO THAT PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THE WORLD CAN SAY THIS SYSTEM WORKS, THIS WAS A FAIR TRIAL, THESE WERE FAIR PEOPLE.SO THANK YOU IN ADVANCE AGAIN FOR YOUR SERVICE, FOR THE VERDICT THAT YOU ARE LIKELY TO RENDER, AND FOR ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU ARE DOING HERE FOR US.

#MR. COCHRAN: ,"THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MR. HODGMAN.I WAS JUST ABOUT TO COMPLIMENT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE ON THEIR OPENING STATEMENT YESTERDAY. MAYBE I WILL TAKE THAT OUT NOW. I WAS ABOUT TO SAY THEY DID A THOROUGH JOB AS FAR AS THEY WENT, BUT THEY ARE ADVOCATES, AND ALL OF US, AS YOU WILL SEE TODAY, HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO TELL YOU THE WHOLE TRUTH OF THESE FACTS.SO IN THE COURSE OF MY STATEMENT TODAY LET ME SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THE THINGS THEY DIDN'T TELL YOU YESTERDAY AND WE WILL HAVE TO WONDER WHY THEY DIDN'T DO THAT.THIS, THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE WE BELIEVE WILL SHOW THAT O.J. SIMPSON IS AN INNOCENT MAN WRONGFULLY ACCUSED. MR. DARDEN SAID YESTERDAY THAT IN RICHMOND, CALIFORNIA, AND SOMEPLACE IN GEORGIA PEOPLE WERE ASKING QUESTIONS.WELL, I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT IN MY HOMETOWN OF SHREVEPORT, LOUISIANA, MY MOTHER-IN-LAW IN NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA, AND OTHER PLACES THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY, THAT THEY ARE ASKING WHY DID MR. DARDEN SPEND ALL THAT TIME ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IF THIS IS A MURDER CASE? WHY DID HE DO THAT?AND THEN WHEN HE GAVE YOU THIS ANSWER, HE WAS GOING TO ANSWER THE QUESTION FOR ALL OF AMERICA. THAT IS A LITTLE PRESUMPTUOUS, DON'T YOU THINK, BECAUSE THE ANSWER OF O.J. SIMPSON'S GUILT OR INNOCENCE CAN ONLY BE DETERMINED BY YOU IF YOU ARE ABLE TO DO IT.NONE OF US WERE OUT THERE ON JUNE 12, 1994. WE CAN ONLY DEAL WITH THE WITNESSES AS THEY WERE.AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS CASE, THE PROSECUTION'S CASE, BASED UPON WHAT WE HEARD AND THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW, THIS CASE IS ABOUT A RUSH TO JUDGMENT, AN OBSESSION TO WIN AT ANY COST AND BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY.THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THE PROSECUTION IN THIS CASE HAS ENLISTED THE SERVICES OF MANY, MANY POLICE AGENCIES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES, THE FBI, MANY LOCAL POLICE AGENCIES. THEY HAVE GONE AROUND THE WORLD TALKING TO WITNESSES.BUT THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THEY FAILED TO GO NEXT DOOR TO MR. SIMPSON'S HOUSE AND TALK TO A WITNESS THAT THEY KNEW ABOUT WHO PROVIDED HIM WITH AN ALIBI, AND THERE ARE OTHER WITNESSES LIKE THAT AND WE WILL HAVE TO ONLY ASK OURSELVES WHY.LET ME JUST BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT THE WITNESSES THAT THEY DIDN'T TALK ABOUT YESTERDAY AND THEY DIDN'T TELL YOU ABOUT. THERE IS A LADY WHO LIVES NEXT DOOR AND WORKS NEXT DOOR TO MR. SIMPSON'S HOME ON ROCKINGHAM. THIS LADY WAS INTERVIEWED AS FAR BACK I THINK AS JULY.SHE INDICATED ESSENTIALLY THAT ON THIS NIGHT IN QUESTION SHE CAME OUT TO WALK HER DOG ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS. SHE KNEW MR. SIMPSON, SHE KNEW HIS VOICE, SHE KNEW THE BRONCO. SHE HAD SEEN IT PARKED THERE MANY TIMES.SHE WILL INDICATE THAT WHEN SHE CAME OUT AND WALKED HER DOG, AT ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK, THAT BRONCO WAS PARKED AT THE CURB THERE AND IT WAS PARKED IN KIND OF A UNIQUE ANGLE SO THAT SHE NOTICED IT, WITH -- THE REAR WHEELS WERE A LITTLE BIT FURTHER FROM THE CURB.AND WHEN YOU GO OUT THERE -- AND I THINK THE COURT WILL PROBABLY SHARE WITH YOU AT SOME POINT YOU ARE GOING TO GET A CHANCE TO GO OUT TO EACH OF THESE SCENES TO SEE FOR YOURSELF THESE AREAS -- WHEN YOU COME OUT OF THE ROCKINGHAM GATE AND YOU MAKE YOUR TURN, THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW, IT IS A QUICK TURN, SO YOU CAN'T LINE THE CAR UP QUITE LIKE YOU WOULD LIKE TO.BUT THIS LADY WILL TESTIFY THAT SHE WAS OUT WITH HER DOG AND SAW THAT BRONCO PARKED AT THAT PARTICULAR ANGLE AT ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK, 8:30 ON JUNE 12, 1994, SUNDAY EVENING.SHE WILL INDICATE TO YOU THAT SHE HEARD MR. SIMPSON'S VOICE AT OR ABOUT THE TIME HE AND MR. KATO KAELIN WENT TO MC DONALD'S TO GET THE HAMBURGER. THAT SHE COULD HEAR BECAUSE HER QUARTERS ARE RIGHT ACROSS THE FENCE THERE. THAT AFTER HE LEFT SHE HEARD SOMETHING VERY STRANGE. SHE HEARD A PROWLER THAT SHE DESCRIBED OUT THERE IN THE YARD WITH LIKE HARD SOLE SHOES AND SHE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THIS PROWLER IS WHAT HER STATEMENT WAS.SHE RELAXED WHEN SHE HEARD MR. SIMPSON RETURN BACK, COULD HEAR HIS VOICE BACK OVER IN THE YARD. SHE WAS CONCERNED BECAUSE THE PEOPLE SHE WORKS FOR WERE OUT OF TOWN AT THIS TIME. SHE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THIS PROWLER, AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT MORE LATER.SHE WENT ABOUT HER BUSINESS AND THEN SHE HEARD MR. SIMPSON'S VOICE AGAIN ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK. SHE COULD HEAR HIS VOICE AT THAT TIME AS THOUGH HE WAS LEAVING. WE KNOW THAT IS CORRECT BECAUSE HE WAS LEAVING TO GO ON A TRIP TO CHICAGO, A PRE-PLANNED TRIP, AND THEN SHE DIDN'T HEAR HIS VOICE ANY MORE.ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS THAT SHE TELLS US IS THAT AFTER MR. SIMPSON HAD LEFT, AFTER ELEVEN O'CLOCK, SHE HEARD MEN'S VOICES OVER ON THE SIMPSON PROPERTY BETWEEN TWELVE O'CLOCK UP UNTIL ABOUT 2:30 OR THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING. SHE HEARD THESE MEN'S VOICES OVER THERE TALKING AND SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON.I HOPE I TOLD YOU THAT WHEN SHE CAME OUT TO WALK HER DOG AT 10:15 THAT SAME NIGHT SHE LOOKED AT THE BRONCO AND THE BRONCO WAS PARKED EXACTLY THE SAME WAY AT THAT CURB, SAME WAY. WHEN SHE SAW THE BRONCO THE NEXT MORNING IT WAS PARKED IN THAT SAME SPOT, THE SAME PLACE.AND ONE OF THE MOST UNIQUE THINGS ABOUT THIS LADY IS THE FACT THAT THE MORNING OF JUNE 14, THAT MONDAY MORNING, POLICE OFFICERS CAME OVER TO HER RESIDENCE AND ASKED HER WHAT SHE HAD HEARD AND TO PUT HER ON ALERT THAT IF SHE FOUND ANY WEAPONS OR IF THE GARDENERS FOUND ANY WEAPONS, TO LET THEM KNOW, AND SHE CAN IDENTIFY THAT OFFICER AS DETECTIVE MARK FUHRMAN.DETECTIVE MARK FUHRMAN WILL PLAY AN INTEGRAL PART IN THIS CASE FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS.NOW, IT IS VERY INTERESTING THAT THE PROSECUTION NEVER ONCE MENTIONED HIS NAME YESTERDAY. IT IS LIKE THEY JUST WANT TO HIDE HIM, BUT THEY CAN'T HIDE HIM, HE IS VERY MUCH A PART OF THIS CASE.WE CAN ONLY ASK OURSELVES WHY DIDN'T THEY MENTION HIM? I THINK THAT ANSWER WILL BECOME VERY CLEAR TO YOU AS THE CASE PROGRESSES.SHE WILL IDENTIFY DETECTIVE FUHRMAN AS THE PERSON WHO CAME OVER AND SPOKE WITH HER AND SHE TOLD HIM AT THAT TIME ABOUT HER OBSERVATIONS, ABOUT HEARING THIS PROWLER AND ABOUT THE FACT THAT SHE HEARD THESE VOICES THAT WENT ON UNTIL ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T GO TO SLEEP UNTIL ABOUT 4:00 AND WHEN SHE WOKE UP IT WAS LIKE 7:30 OR 8:00 AND HE WAS THERE SHOWING HIS BADGE THROUGH THE DOOR. AND SHE SAW HIM ON TELEVISION AT THE PRELIMINARY HEARING, SO THAT IS HOW SHE COULD IDENTIFY HIM.HE SAID THAT SOMEBODY FROM THE LAPD WILL GET BACK TO YOU, BUT THEY NEVER CAME BACK. THEY NEVER CAME BACK AT ALL BECAUSE THERE IS A RUSH TO JUDGMENT HERE.THERE IS ANOTHER WITNESS, MARYANNE GERCHAS, A VERY INTERESTING LADY, HAS HER OWN BUSINESS, AND ON THIS PARTICULAR NIGHT IN JUNE OF 1994, JUNE 12 AGAIN, SHE WANTED TO FIND A PLACE IN THE WEST LOS ANGELES BRENTWOOD AREA.SHE DROVE HER CAR AFTER SHE CLOSED UP HER BUSINESS ON SUNDAY EVENING AND WENT TO THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, WENT TO MASS AND WENT AND PARKED HER CAR AND SHE CAME OVER THERE ON BUNDY. VERY INTERESTING.BEFORE I TELL YOU WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY, LET ME TELL YOU HER CONTACT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT MARYANNE GERCHAS, AFTER SHE BECAME AWARE THAT WHAT SHE HAD SEEN HAD SOME GREAT RELEVANCE TO THIS CASE, STARTED CALLING THE POLICE. SHE KEPT BEING TRANSFERRED AND TRANSFERRED AROUND, COULDN'T GET ANYBODY REALLY TO TALK TO HER.FINALLY WHEN SHE FINALLY REACHED A POLICE OFFICER, THEY TOLD HER WE'VE GOT THAT CASE ALL WRAPPED UP AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR FROM ANYBODY ELSE, AND THEN LO AND BEHOLD SHE CALLED THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, SPOKE TO A PERSON WHOSE NAME WILL BE REVEALED DURING THE TESTIMONY, AND SHE DIDN'T FEEL SHE WAS TREATED QUITE APPROPRIATELY.IN FACT, SHE WILL SAY THAT THE PERSON PUT HER ON HOLD AND SAID, ""EXCUSE ME, I'M TALKING TO A PSYCHIC RIGHT NOW AND I WILL GET BACK TO YOU."" I GUESS IT WAS PART OF THAT HOTLINE THEY HAD. SO IT SEEMS THEY WERE MORE INTERESTED IN TALKING TO A PSYCHIC THAN TALKING TO HER.SO ULTIMATELY SHE CALLED THE DEFENSE AND WE TALKED TO HER, WALKED WITH HER OUT AT THE SCENE.HERE IS WHAT SHE WILL TESTIFY ABOUT. THAT ON JUNE 12, 1994, SOME TIME AFTER 10:30 IN THE EVENING, SHE IS WALKING DOWN BUNDY, SHE IS LOOKING -- IT IS A WARM NIGHT, SHE SAYS, AND SHE IS LOOKING FOR PLACES THAT HAVE SIGNS UP TO RENT OR TO LEASE, THAT MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S CONDO, YOU RECALL, IS ON ONE SIDE OF THE STREET, THE WEST SIDE, AND SHE IS ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE STREET.AND AT ABOUT 10:45 P.M. SHE SEES FOUR MEN WHO COME WITHIN TEN FEET OF HER, TWO OF WHICH, GENTLEMEN, APPEARED TO BE HISPANIC, I THINK THE OTHERS ARE CAUCASIANS, SEVERAL OF WHICH I BELIEVE HAVE KNIT CAPS ON THEIR HEADS. THE TWO WHO ARE BEHIND APPARENTLY HAVE SOMETHING IN THEIR HANDS THEY ARE CARRYING. SHE THINKS THEY MAY BE UNDERCOVER POLICE, SHE DOESN'T KNOW. THEY GET INTO AN UNMARKED CAR AND THEY SPEED AWAY AND SHE SEES THEM.AND THAT IS WHAT THIS LADY WAS TRYING TO TELL THE POLICE, TRYING TO TELL THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY, TRYING TO TELL ANYBODY WHO WOULD LISTEN, BUT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO LISTEN, BECAUSE THEY MADE THEIR DECISION IN THIS RUSH TO JUDGMENT.THERE ARE OTHER WITNESSES, THAT I WON'T BOTHER YOU RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE WILL TALK ABOUT THEM LATER ON IN THE COURSE OF THE OPENING STATEMENT, THAT BEAR UPON THAT EVENING, BUT WE WILL JUST SAY TWO OF THEM BECAUSE IT SETS THE STAGE FOR MANY OF THE REMARKS MISS CLARK MADE YESTERDAY.YOU RECALL THAT IN HER OPENING STATEMENT, QUITE WELL DONE, MISS CLARK KEPT TELLING YOU THAT SHE HAD TO FIX THE TIME OF DEATH IN THIS CASE AT ABOUT, WHAT DID SHE SAY, ABOUT 10:15. SHE HAD TO MAKE IT 10:15 AND SHE MADE IT BASED UPON A DOG'S WAIL AND THIS IS THE FIRST CASE YOU WILL EVER HEAR WHERE THE PROSECUTION'S THEORY IS THAT YOU HAVE GOT TO DETERMINE THE TIME OF DEATH BY A DOG'S WAIL, IN THIS MOST SCIENTIFIC OF ALL CASES, AND THERE IS A REASON WHY SHE WANTS THAT, BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO GIVE ENOUGH TIME FOR HER THEORY ABOUT O.J. SIMPSON TO WORK.BUT WE WILL PRODUCE FOR YOU -- AND HOPEFULLY ALL THESE WITNESSES WILL BE AVAILABLE. AS YOU ARE WELL AWARE, THESE WITNESSES ARE AFRAID. IT COULD BE BECAUSE OF ALL THE MEDIA ATTENTION. AND WHAT I SAY TO YOU IS WHAT THESE WITNESSES HAVE SAID TO US AT THIS POINT. TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN TO MEZZALUNA RESTAURANT, THE SAME RESTAURANT, MR. DAN MANDEL AND MISS ELLEN ARRONSON, THEY HAVE BEEN ON A BLIND DATE, LIKE THEIR FIRST DATE, AND THEY ARE WALKING HOME.THEY WALK HOME AND THEY COME RIGHT DOWN BUNDY ALSO. IT IS VERY INTERESTING, AS THEY WALK DOWN BUNDY, THEY WALK ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE STREET RIGHT PASSED 875, NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S RESIDENCE, AND THEY WALK PASSED THERE, AND IT IS INTERESTING, BECAUSE AS YOU SAW FROM THOSE PICTURES -- AND WE ALL APOLOGIZE YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THOSE PICTURES AND CERTAINLY TO THE FAMILY AND WE WANT TO BE AS CAREFUL AS WE CAN WITH THOSE PICTURES -- BUT IF YOU SAW THOSE PICTURES, YOU COULD SEE WITH THE GATE OPEN AND YOU WALK RIGHT PASSED, THE SIDEWALK COMES RIGHT DOWN AND THE BODIES WERE VERY VISIBLE WITH THE GATE OPEN.THEY DIDN'T SEE ANY GATE OPEN OR ANY BODIES OR ANYTHING AND IT WAS LIKE 10:25, 10:25 AT THAT POINT, SO WHAT DOES THAT DO TO THEIR THEORY ABOUT 10:15 AND THE DOGS? WHO ARE WE GOING -- WELL, I WON'T BE ARGUING THAT TO YOU.AT ANY RATE, THERE WILL BE EVIDENCE THAT AT 10:25 THAT PEOPLE WHO WALK PASSED, WHO HAVE NO AX TO GRIND, HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS CASE, WHO THEY KNOW ABOUT AND WE KNOW ABOUT, DON'T SEE ANY CRIME HAVING BEEN COMMITTED. THERE ARE OTHER WITNESSES WHO ARE GOING TO TESTIFY THEY DON'T HEAR ANY DOG BARKING AT 10:15 OR NO PLAINTIVE WAIL, WHATEVER THAT MEANS.SO IN THIS INITIAL PHASE OF THE OPENING STATEMENT WHAT I'VE TRIED TO SHARE WITH YOU IS THAT ALL OF US, IT SEEMS TO ME, HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO SHARE WITH YOU AND BE AS HONEST AND FORTHRIGHT AS WE CAN.IN THAT CONNECTION YOU WILL RECALL THAT MISS CLARK YESTERDAY TALKED ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS ABOUT THE LIMOUSINE DRIVER AND WHAT HE SAW. YOU RECALL SHE SAID TO YOU THAT THE LIMOUSINE DRIVER, WHEN HE CAME AND LEFT TO TAKE MR. SIMPSON TO THE AIRPORT, SHE TOLD YOU THAT HE DID NOT SEE THE BRONCO PARKED THERE.THAT IS NOT EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID IN HIS TESTIMONY AT THE PRELIMINARY HEARING AND THE GRAND JURY AND I WOULD LIKE TO READ THAT TO YOU IF I MIGHT.HE SAYS THIS QUESTION:""DID YOU MAKE AN EFFORT TO LOOK AND SEE IF THERE WERE ANY CARS THERE?""ANSWER: I LOOKED TO THE RIGHT TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY CARS COMING DOWN THE STREET.""WELL, I'M ASKING YOU IF YOU LOOKED"" --

SIMPSON, WE ARE GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE TRAILS THAT THEY DIDN'T PURSUE OR DIDN'T GO DOWN TODAY.WE ARE ALSO GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS EVIDENCE, WHAT WE CALL THE LACK OF INTEGRITY OF MUCH OF THE PROSECUTION'S EVIDENCE.YOU SAW YESTERDAY SOME PICTURES OF THE -- OF THIS CRIME SCENE, AND THE CRIME SCENE WAS CERTAINLY BLOODY, WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, BUT I THINK YOU WILL FIND THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THE LAPD, IN ITS INFINITE WISDOM IN THIS CASE, ASSIGNED A TRAINEE NAMED MAZZOLLA WHO WAS THE OFFICER IN CHARGE OF COLLECTING THIS EVIDENCE. THIS WAS HER THIRD CRIME SCENE.AND CONTRARY TO WHAT YOU HEARD YESTERDAY FROM MISS CLARK, OUR EXPERTS -- AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF EXPERTS THAT WE WILL CALL TO TESTIFY. IN FACT, ONE OF OUR EXPERTS IS NAMED DR. KARY MULLIS. LET ME TELL YOU WHO DR. KARY MULLIS IS. DR. KARY MULLIS IS A DNA EXPERT. HE IS THE MAN WHO INVENTED PCR, POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION. HE IS THE MAN WHO RECEIVED THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE FOR THIS INVENTION.AND HE WILL COME IN HERE AND TELL YOU ABOUT THIS EVIDENCE, HOW SENSITIVE IT IS AND HOW THESE POLICE DEPARTMENTS ARE NOT TRAINED IN THE COLLECTION AND USE OF IT, THAT THIS IS BY ALL ACCOUNTS, 21ST CENTURY CYBERSPACE TECHNOLOGY THAT IS USED BY THESE POLICE DEPARTMENTS WITH COVERED WAGON TECHNOLOGY.AND SO WHEN MISS CLARK TELLS YOU YESTERDAY THAT IT IS POSSIBLE -- LIKE COOKING OR DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT, SHE SAID SHE WASN'T AN EXPERT, AND I AGREE NOW ON THAT AT LEAST -- SHE IS AN EXPERT LAWYER, BUT NOT IN THIS AREA -- THE EXPERTS WILL SAY THAT IS JUST NOT TRUE.AND SO THE COLLECTION OF THE EVIDENCE BECOMES VERY, VERY, VERY IMPORTANT IN THIS CASE.AND SO, YOU KNOW, WHEN THEY WERE TRYING TO HIDE FUHRMAN YESTERDAY -- THERE WERE A COUPLE OF PICTURES YESTERDAY OF AN OFFICER LEANING DOWN POINTING AT THE GLOVE AND THE CAP AND EVERYTHING AND YOU NOTICE THAT THEY TALKED ABOUT IT, THAT WAS OFFICER FUHRMAN. NEVER BOTHERED TO MENTION HIS NAME, NEVER BOTHERED WITH THAT.AND SO WE HAVE THEN THIS CONCEPT OF THE PROSECUTION'S THEORIES. YOU HEARD MR. DARDEN STAND UP AND TELL YOU HIS THEORY OF HOW THIS HAPPENED, AND THE THEORY IS ONLY GOOD UNTIL THE FACTS COME ALONG AND MAKE CLEAR TO YOU WHAT ACTUALLY TOOK PLACE.AND SO WE THINK THAT IF YOU KEEP AN OPEN MIND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THESE THEORIES AND THEN APPLY THE FACTS, WHICH IS YOUR JOB AS THE SOLE EXCLUSIVE JUDGES OF THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE.NOW, MR. DARDEN, WHEN HE ADDRESS YOU YESTERDAY, SPENT A LONG PERIOD OF TIME TALKING ABOUT MR. O.J. SIMPSON'S MARRIAGE TO MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON AND HE SPENT A LOT OF TIME AND HE TOLD YOU A NUMBER OF THINGS.HE TOLD YOU HOW, FOR INSTANCE, THAT THIS WAS LIKE A TERRIBLE MARRIAGE AND THAT ALL KIND OF BAD THINGS HAPPENED, AND THESE PEOPLE WERE TOGETHER SEVENTEEN YEARS AND IT WAS JUST -- JUST TERRIBLE ALL SEVENTEEN YEARS.I THINK YOU WILL FIND THAT IS NOT EXACTLY TRUE. HE TOLD YOU HOW MR. SIMPSON WAS IN, HOW DO YOU DESCRIBE IT, AN UGLY MOOD ON JUNE 12, 1994. HE TOLD YOU ALSO THAT MR. SIMPSON CAME THERE WITH SOME FLOWERS, BUT WE WILL FORGIVE HIM FOR THAT. MR. SIMPSON DIDN'T COME WITH FLOWERS.THE TESTIMONY WILL BE HE WAS THERE, HE LEFT AND WENT AND GOT THE FLOWERS AND THEN CAME BACK.BUT LET ME TRY TO SHOW YOU GRAPHICALLY MR. SIMPSON WITH HIS DAUGHTER.AND YOUR HONOR, I AM NOW REFERRING TO A PHOTOGRAPH AND I NEED TO CHECK WITH MY COLLEAGUES, AND I BELIEVE THIS WILL BE DEFENDANT'S 1, IF THE COURT WOULD ALLOW, WHICHEVER.

SIMPSON AND HIS SWEET LITTLE DAUGHTER, SYDNEY BROOK SIMPSON, SHORTLY AFTER THIS CONCERT AT PAUL REVERE HIGH SCHOOL.THIS PICTURE WAS TAKEN, AND I THINK YOU WILL EVEN SEE THE DATE, 6/12/94.THIS PICTURE WAS TAKEN BY A DR. RON FICHMAN WHO WAS AT THAT PARTICULAR RECITAL. THEY WERE ALL FRIENDS. HE WILL TELL YOU THAT SINCE MR. DARDEN WASN'T THERE, HE HAS GOT HIS FACTS ALL WRONG.O.J. SIMPSON, ACCORDING TO THE TESTIMONY, WAS NOT IN ANY UGLY MOOD. HE TALKED TO RON FICHMAN, HE WAS THERE TO SEE HIS CHILD, AND YOU WILL HEAR THAT HE CAME BACK TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FROM NEW YORK CITY WHERE HE WAS ON BUSINESS, HE WAS OUT OF TOWN ALMOST ALL THAT WEEK, SPECIFICALLY TO TRY AND COME TO THIS RECITAL.HE HAD TO LEAVE RIGHT AFTER THIS TO GO TO CHICAGO. HE WAS ALREADY BACK EAST IN NEW YORK. AND WE WILL PRODUCE A FRIEND WHO TOLD HIM WHY DON'T YOU JUST SAY BACK HERE, AND MR. SIMPSON TOLD HIM ""I MISSED MY DAUGHTER'S FIRST COMMUNION BECAUSE I WAS OUT OF TOWN ON BUSINESS, SO I WANT TO GO TO THIS DANCE RECITAL"" AND THAT IS WHAT HE DID.DOES THAT LOOK LIKE HE IS IN AN UGLY MOOD THERE? AND YOU WILL SEE THE TWO OF THEM THERE AT THAT POINT.WHEREVER WE CAN WE ARE GOING TO BRING TO YOU THE FACTS VERSUS THEIR SPECULATIONS AND THEORIES WITH THIS MAN.THEY DON'T KNOW THIS MAN. WITH THE EVIDENCE, YOU WILL KNOW HIM, BY THE CONCLUSION OF THIS CASE.AND SO MR. DARDEN KIND OF APOLOGIZES AT THE END AND SAYS THIS ISN'T CHARACTER ASSASSINATION, YOU KNOW, WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS THAT. WHO SAID IT WAS CHARACTER ASSASSINATION? BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS.SO AT THE VERY END WHEN HE SAID IT WASN'T CHARACTER ASSASSINATION, THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HE HAD DONE FOR AN HOUR TO O.J. SIMPSON. HE IS NOT CHARGED WITH ANY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THIS IS A MURDER CASE.AND IN THEY PURSUIT TO WIN THEY ARE TRYING TO DREDGE UP SOME THEORY TO GIVE YOU A MOTIVE, BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A MOTIVE FOR THIS AND THESE PARTICULAR CRIMES. AND WHO IS TO SAY THAT THOSE FOUR MEN WE SAW RUNNING FROM THE AREA OF 875 HADN'T FOLLOWED MR. RON GOLDMAN THERE, AS OPPOSED TO LOOKING FOR MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?

I THINK I WAS INDICATING TO YOU WHO IS TO SAY, BASED UPON THE FACTS IN THIS CASE AND THE EVIDENCE, THAT THOSE FOUR MEN THAT MARYANNE GERCHAS WILL TESTIFY ABOUT HADN'T FOLLOWED MR. RON GOLDMAN TO THAT LOCATION?ANOTHER THING THAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY THAT IS NOT TRUE THAT THEY TOLD YOU, MISS CLARK TOLD YOU THAT MR. RON GOLDMAN CHECKED OUT OF WORK AND HE WAS GOING TO COME OVER AND DO A FAVOR FOR MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON TO BRING THE GLASSES, AND SHE DESCRIBED FOR YOU HOW HE WAS DRESSED. I THINK SHE SAID WITH SOME WHITE SHIRT AND BLACK PANTS OR WHATEVER AND THAT HE THEN CAME OVER TO THE RESIDENCE.YOU SAW THOSE PICTURES, AS TERRIBLE AS THEY WERE. HE WAS IN SOME JEANS AND SOME KIND OF SHOES THAT ARE FAR DIFFERENT. AND THE EVIDENCE WILL BE HE WENT HOME, DROPPED OFF A BOOK, CHANGED CLOTHES BEFORE HE CAME TO NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON.BUT THE REASON THAT YOU WEREN'T TOLD THOSE FACTS IS BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT THEY KEEP THIS 10:15 TIME. THEY HAVE GOT TO KEEP EVERYTHING SQUASHED IN THERE SO THEY COULD TELL YOU, OH, HE HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO COMMIT THIS CRIME.WHEN WE CONCLUDE TODAY YOU ARE GOING TO SEE THERE WAS NO TIME TO COMMIT THIS CRIME.AND SO TO WRAP UP THIS PART ABOUT THE SO-CALLED CHARACTER ASSASSINATION OR WHATEVER, WHAT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO, AS WITH ALL OF THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE, IS TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND UNTIL YOU'VE HEARD BOTH SIDES.THEY MAY TRY TO BRING OUT INCIDENTS ABOUT THIS MARRIAGE. AND THESE PEOPLE DID DIVORCE IN 1992, AND UNFORTUNATELY IN OUR SOCIETY THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY DIVORCES. PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS GET ALONG AND WE SOMETIMES GET DIVORCED. SOME OF YOU PROBABLY HAVE GOTTEN DIVORCED AND IT IS UNFORTUNATE WHEN THAT HAPPENS.BUT I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND, BUT I THINK PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THIS WHOLE AREA IS THIS AS A RESPONSE TO MR. DARDEN:THERE IS AN EXPERT IN THE UNITED STATES WHOSE NAME IS DR. LENORE WALKER. SHE IS BY ALL ACCOUNTS THE NO. 1 EXPERT IN AMERICA ON THE FIELD OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. SHE HAS BEEN CALLED BY SOME THE MOTHER OF THE BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME.NOW, THEY DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY, BUT LENORE WALKER WILL BE A WITNESS FOR THE DEFENSE, AND I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HER AND HER TESTIMONY, BECAUSE I THINK IT WILL BE RELEVANT AS WE TALK ABOUT MR. DARDEN AND WHAT HE HAS TO SAY ON THIS AREA.WE KNOW THAT MR. DARDEN IS NOT AN EXPERT IN THIS AREA; HE IS A LAWYER CONVEYING THE FACTS AS HE UNDERSTOOD THEM, BUT HE WASN'T THERE.DR. LENORE WALKER, THIS NO. 1 EXPERT IN AMERICA, PERHAPS IN THE WORLD, IN THIS CONCEPT, HAS SEEN AND INTERVIEWED AND TESTED MR. SIMPSON. SHE HASN'T CONCLUDED ALL THE TESTING YET, BUT SHE WILL TESTIFY TO YOU ABOUT THE RESULTS OF THOSE TESTS WHEN SHE IS COMPLETED, BUT SHE HAS AND DOES HAVE SOME FEELINGS ABOUT THIS CASE AND ABOUT MR. DARDEN'S REMARKS.IN FACT, AS AN EXPERT SHE IS PERMITTED TO WATCH MR. DARDEN AND SHE WATCHED HIM YESTERDAY AND SHE WAS KIND ENOUGH TO SHARE WITH ME LAST NIGHT WHAT HER THOUGHTS WERE.

","JANUARY 25, 1995 ",9:11 A.M.
#MR. COCHRAN: ,"YOU ARE ABSOLUTE RIGHT, AND LET ME RESTATE THAT IN A POSITIVE WAY, YOUR HONOR.WITH REGARD TO MR. DARDEN'S STATEMENTS YESTERDAY, YOU RECALL MR. DARDEN SAID THAT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON NEVER HELD A JOB AND HE WANTED TO PAINT THIS PICTURE OF HER BEING TOTALLY UNDER CONTROL AND BEING CONTROLLED BY O.J. SIMPSON, AND UNDER HIS THUMB AND THAT SORT OF THING.WELL, I THINK THAT SOME OF US WOULD FEEL THAT SOMEBODY WHO RAISES TWO CHILDREN, WHO IS AN EXCELLENT MOTHER, THAT IS A PRETTY MAJOR JOB, BEING A HOMEMAKER, AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT NICOLE SIMPSON WAS A BARBIE DOLL THAT WOULD JUST MAKE IN THEIR OWN MOLD, BECAUSE EVEN IN DARDEN'S STATEMENT HE SAID THIS WAS A STRONG TOUGH LADY AND I THINK YOU WILL FIND THAT IS WHAT THE EVIDENCE IS GOING TO BE.BUT WITH REGARD TO THIS WHOLE ASPECT OF BATTERING, IN THIS CASE LET ME SAY UP FRONT THAT MR. SIMPSON IS NOT PROUD AT ALL OF THE FACT THAT HE AND HIS WIFE GOT INTO AN ALTERCATION AND SHE WAS STRUCK ON JANUARY 1ST, 1989. HE IS NOT PROUD OF THAT.IN FACT, IN THE COURSE OF THIS EVIDENCE YOU ARE GOING TO SEE PERHAPS THREE LETTERS THAT HE WROTE APOLOGIZING TO HIS WIFE, BUT WHAT MR. DARDEN AND WHAT THE EVIDENCE HASN'T SHOWN YOU SO FAR WAS THAT FROM 1989, JANUARY 1ST, 1989, HE MADE A BIG THING OUT OF THAT, FROM THAT DAY FORWARD, TO THE PRESENT DATE, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT O.J. SIMPSON EVER STRUCK HIS WIFE AGAIN. YOU SHOULD NEVER STRIKE YOUR WIFE, BUT EVEN WHEN HE MADE A MISTAKE ON JANUARY 1ST, '89, HE PAID HIS DEBT FOR THAT.HE WENT TO COURT AND HE PLED NOLO CONTENDERE. HE PLED NO CONTEST FOR THAT. HE WAS SENTENCED TO COMMUNITY SERVICE AND HE REPAID HIS DEBT. NOW, THEY WANT TO RETRY HIM, I SUPPOSE. THEY DON'T TELL YOU THAT AFTER THAT THERE IS NOT ANY TOUCHING.IN FACT, O.J. SIMPSON DID SOMETHING ELSE. AFTER THAT INCIDENT HE WAS SO CONTRITE THAT HE HAD A PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT WITH NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON. THEY GOT A DIVORCE, WHAT HER SHARE WOULD BE, AND HE WENT AND HE HAD HIS LAWYER PUT IN WRITING, WHICH WAS LATER SIGNED BY HER, THAT IF I EVER STRIKE YOU AGAIN THE PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT IS VOIDABLE, AND UNTIL THE DATE OF HER DEATH THAT AGREEMENT WAS NEVER MADE VOID OR VOIDABLE.NOW, THOSE ARE THE FACTS. AND SO WHEN DR. WALKER COMES AND TESTIFIES TO YOU SHE WILL TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT LIFE THREATENING VIOLENCE USUALLY PRECEDES A HOMICIDE INCIDENT AND SHE DOES NOT FIND THAT IN THIS CASE.SHE WILL, I BELIEVE, TESTIFY THAT ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE, APPROXIMATELY TWO AND ONE-HALF MILLION WOMEN ARE BATTERED IN THIS COUNTRY EVERY YEAR, AN INTOLERABLE SITUATION. STATISTICS INDICATE, HOWEVER, THAT BETWEEN 1200 AND 4000 OF THOSE WOMEN ARE KILLED. THAT IS 1200 TO 4000 OF THE TWO AND ONE-HALF MILLION BATTERED.DR. WALKER WILL TESTIFY THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO USE THESE STATISTICS TO PROVE THAT ANYBODY WHO ALLEGEDLY BATTERS BECOMES A MURDERER.YOU MIGHT LIKEN IT TO AN EXAMPLE OF SMOKING. SOMEBODY MAY GET LUNG CANCER. THE FACT THAT THEY GET LUNG CANCER MAY MEAN THEY SMOKE AND MAY NOT, BUT IF YOU SMOKE, I CAN'T AUTOMATICALLY PREDICT YOU ARE GOING TO GET LUNG CANCER.AND SO THIS IS NOT A PREDICTABLE SCIENCE, ACCORDING TO THE LADY WHO IS THE MOTHER OF THIS PARTICULAR AREA, AND ALTHOUGH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS A VERY, VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY, THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE IN THIS CASE, THE PATTERN IS ATYPICAL. ATYPICAL MEANS UNTYPICAL OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WHERE A LETHAL INCIDENT OFTEN OCCURS.FOR INSTANCE, STALKERS DON'T GO ALL ACROSS THE UNITED STATES WORKING DOING COMMERCIALS, SHOOTING MOVIES, HAVING A NEW GIRLFRIEND AND GOING ON WITH THEIR LIFE AND DOING ALL THE THINGS YOU ARE GOING TO FIND THIS EVIDENCE IS ABOUT.THEY DON'T HAVE A NEW GIRLFRIEND BY THE NAME OF PAULA BARBIERI WHO YOU HAVE BEEN VERY SERIOUS ABOUT FROM THE TIME -- FROM APRIL OF 1992 TO APRIL OF 1993 UNTIL NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON ASKED TO RECONCILE AND GET BACK TOGETHER.SHE DID IT IN THIS WAY:SHE SENT TO MR. SIMPSON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A VIDEO OF THEIR MARRIAGE, A VIDEO OF THE BIRTH OF THEIR CHILDREN, ACCOMPANIED BY A LONG LETTER SPELLING OUT HOW MUCH SHE WANTED TO GET BACK WITH THIS FAMILY.NOW, I THINK YOU WILL FIND THAT IS NOT STALKING. MR. SIMPSON'S RESPONSE WAS WE HAVE HAD PROBLEMS IN THE PAST, I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND NOW, I'M HAPPY, LET'S TAKE OUR TIME ABOUT THIS. BUT SHE PURSUED. SHE FOLLOWED UP ON THAT. SHE PURSUED. SHE WANTED TO MOVE BACK TO ROCKINGHAM. SHE DIDN'T LIKE THE HOUSEKEEPER THERE. SHE WANTED TO FIRE HER. MICHELLE IS HER NAME. AND ULTIMATELY SHE GOT INTO AN ALTERCATION AND STRUCK MICHELLE. HE DIDN'T WANT TO FIRE MICHELLE. ULTIMATELY MICHELLE DID LEAVE AFTER BEING STRUCK. IT WAS HER WHO PURSUED THIS IN MAY OF 1993 UNTIL MAY OF 1994.AND WHEN MR. DARDEN TALKED TO YOU YESTERDAY, HE DIDN'T MENTION THAT AND WE WILL CONCLUSIVELY PROVE THAT TO YOU SO THAT WHEN DR. WALKER TALKS TO YOU ABOUT STALKERS DEMONSTRATE OBSESSIVE BEHAVIOR, THAT CONCENTRATES ON CONTROLLING THE WOMAN AT ALL TIMES AND IS INCONSISTENT WITH MAKING A NEW LIFE, BEGINNING A NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH A WOMAN SUCH AS PAULA BARBIERI, TRAVELING AWAY FROM HOME ON BUSINESS ASSIGNMENTS. ALL OF THOSE THINGS GO AGAINST ANY IDEA OF STALKING THAT THEY WOULD HAVE YOU ALSO BELIEVE IN THIS CASE.DR. WALKER WILL ALSO TELL YOU THAT THERE IS A MAJOR, MAJOR, MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A WEALTHY PERSON WHO GIVES GIFTS, SOMEONE WHO USES MATERIAL POSSESSIONS TO GAIN POWER, AND SO THE PROSECUTION WOULD HAVE YOU BELIEVE THAT IF MR. SIMPSON GIVES NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON A GIFT, SOMETHING THAT HE BOUGHT AND PAID FOR, NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH.LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF THE TESTIMONY THAT WILL COME OUT IN THIS CASE.BEFORE MR. SIMPSON EVER GOT MARRIED TO HIS WIFE HE BOUGHT HER A CONDOMINIUM IN SAN FRANCISCO AND PAID $500,000 FOR IT AND GAVE IT TO HER FREE AND CLEAR IN HER NAME SO SHE COULD HAVE MONEY UP TO $3,000 A MONTH. HE NEVER EVER SAW ANY OF THAT MONEY, WANTED ANY OF THAT MONEY. THERE WHERE NO STRINGS ATTACHED. THIS IS BEFORE THEY GOT MARRIED.AND LATER ON IN THIS DISCUSSION I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT I CALL HIS CIRCLE OF BENEVOLENCE, THOSE WHO HAVE COME WITHIN THE AMBIT AND THAT SPHERE OF O.J. SIMPSON AND HIS PHILANTHROPIC LARGESSE, WHAT HE HAS DONE FOR THEM, AND THERE ARE MANY OTHER THINGS. THIS $500,000 CONDO FREE AND CLEAR. HE GAVE HER SOME MORE MONEY TO BUY THE CONDO ON BUNDY. THESE ARE ALL HER OWN SEPARATE THINGS WHILE THEY ARE STILL SEPARATED. HE ASKED FOR NO CONTROL. SHE HAD HER OWN BANK ACCOUNTS. HE GAVE HER $4,000 A MONTH FOR FOOD AT THE HOUSE AND HE PAID ALL OF THE BILLS WHEN THEY WERE TOGETHER.LET ME TALK ABOUT THIS CIRCLE OF BENEVOLENCE WHILE WE ARE ON IT RIGHT NOW. IT EXTENDED NOT JUST TO MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, BUT TO HER FAMILY, TO MR. LOU BROWN. HE HELPED HIM BECOME A HERTZ LICENSEE AT THE RITZ CARLTON IN LAGUNA BEACH FOR SEVEN YEARS. THE SISTERS, DOMINIQUE, PAID THE TUITION FOR DOMINIQUE FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS AT USC UNTIL SHE DROPPED OUT.PAID THE TUITION FOR TONYA, THE OTHER SISTER, FOR SAN DIEGO STATE FOR A YEAR OR SO UNTIL SHE DROPPED OUT. THERE IS A COUSIN, ROTH BAUER, WHO WORKED FOR SEVEN YEARS IN MR. O.J. SIMPSON'S CHICKEN FRANCHISE, PIONEER CHICKEN FRANCHISES. THE MOTHER JUDITHA WAS A TRAVEL AGENT. HE GAVE HER HIS BUSINESS AND ENCOURAGED HIS FRIENDS TO DO LIKEWISE.THIS MAN HAD A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS IN-LAWS. HE DID WONDERFUL THINGS FOR HIM, TOOK THEM ALL ON TRIPS, PAID THEIR WAY, TOOK THEM ALL OUT TO DINNER, THEY WOULD GO TO HAWAII AND CABO SAN LUCAS. THIS IS THE SAME MAN THAT MR. DARDEN WAS TALKING TO YOU ABOUT.MR. DARDEN SAYS SHE NEVER WORKED. O.J. SIMPSON ENCOURAGED HER TO BECOME A DECORATOR. SHE BECAME A DECORATOR. HE HELPED HER GET JOBS FROM HIS FRIENDS. SHE REDECORATED THE ROCKINGHAM HOUSE TO THE TUNE OF ONE-HALF MILLION DOLLARS AND HE PAID HER, HIS PAID HIS OWN WIFE A FEE TO DECORATE THE HOUSE.THIS MAN THAT DARDEN WAS TALKING ABOUT, THIS MAN GIVES $5,000 EVERY YEAR TO THE ANGEL CITY LINKS, THE INNER CITY BLACK ORGANIZATION, AND THE ONLY CONDITION OF HIS GIFT EVERY YEAR IS IT HAS TO BE ANONYMOUS, THAT HE DOESN'T WANT THEM TO KNOW HE DOES THIS.THE THING THAT HE IS PERHAPS PROUDEST ABOUT ARE THESE THINGS, TWO THINGS THAT I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT. NO. 1 WAS HIS MOTHER EUNICE SIMPSON. AS SOON AS SHE WAS ABLE HE BOUGHT HER A HOUSE. SHE STILL LIVES IN THAT HOUSE IN SAN FRANCISCO. THIS IS A MAN 47 YEARS OLD WHO GREW UP IN THE POOR AREAS OF SAN FRANCISCO IN POTRERO HILLS, BUT HE NEVER GOT -- HE BECAME RICH AND FAMOUS, BUT HE DIDN'T FORGET, SO THAT TO THIS DAY HE BUYS THE UNIFORMS FOR THE KIDS AT THE POTRERO HILL GYMNASIUM WHERE THE KIDS GO TO WORK OUT. HE STILL DOES THAT EVEN RIGHT NOW EVEN WHILE IN HIS JAIL CELL. BOUGHT HIS MOTHER'S HOUSE. YOU WILL HEAR ABOUT THOSE KIND OF THINGS.AND THE SECOND THING HE IS MOST PROUD ABOUT IS THAT HE HAD A CHILD WHO DROWNED AT A YOUNG AGE, AND THAT IS ALWAYS A TRAGEDY, YOU WILL HEAR EVIDENCE ABOUT THAT, AND THE PRONOUNCED AFFECT THAT IT HAD ON HIM, AND AFTER THAT HE BECAME INVOLVED IN ALL THESE KIND OF PEDIATRIC ENDEAVORS AND HE HAS PARTICIPATED IN RAISING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR CAMP GOOD TIME, FOR KIDS WHO HAVE CANCER.HE IS VERY PROUD ABOUT THAT AND THERE IS TESTIMONY AND EVIDENCE ABOUT THAT. PEOPLE WHO KNOW HIM, NOT PEOPLE WHO SPECULATE ABOUT HIM, WILL COME IN AND TESTIFY ABOUT THOSE THINGS.AND SO WHEN DR. WALKER TELLS YOU THAT FOR A WEALTHY PERSON TO GIVE GIFTS DOESN'T MEAN YOU ARE EXERCISING ANY CONTROL.ONE OF THE SISTERS NEEDED SOME MONEY, UP TO $5,000, AND HE GAVE IT TO THE SISTER AND HER BOYFRIEND AND THE CONDITION WAS DON'T TELL NICOLE. THAT IS A LOT OF CONTROL, ISN'T IT?SO WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT THEORIES, I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE FACTS.SO YOU WILL HEAR FROM DR. WALKER AND YOU WILL HEAR ULTIMATELY ABOUT THE BATTERY OF TESTS AND I THINK YOU WILL FIND THAT SHE WILL SAY THAT IN LOOKING AT O.J. SIMPSON AND INTERVIEWING HIM, IN LOOKING AT HIM, AT THIS POINT SHE FINDS NO EVIDENCE OF ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY DISORDER AND I THINK YOU WILL FIND THAT BECOMES VERY IMPORTANT IN THIS CASE.AND UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS NO JANEY COME LATELY. THIS IS THE LEADING LADY IN AMERICA WHO TESTIFIES IN THESE KIND CASES WHERE A BATTERED WOMAN SHOOTS AND KILLS HER HUSBAND, SO THIS IS AN AREA WHERE OBVIOUSLY YOU WILL GET A CHANCE TO SEE HER QUALIFICATIONS AND HER ABILITY AS SHE GOES ABOUT THIS.NOW, BACK TO MR. DARDEN'S DISCUSSION, HE TELLS YOU A NUMBER OF THINGS AND I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS AT LEAST SOME OF THEM WITH YOU NOW. WE HAVE ALREADY COVERED THE SO-CALLED UGLY MOOD BY SHOWING YOU THE PHOTOGRAPH. WE HAVE COVERED THE ASPECT OF THE FLOWERS BECAUSE MR. SIMPSON DID GET FLOWERS, BUT HE WENT OUT AND GOT THOSE FLOWERS.WE WILL COVER THE ASPECT -- LET ME TALK TO YOU ABOUT MR. SIMPSON AT THAT PARTICULAR RECITAL. I HAVE TOLD YOU HOW HE CAME BACK TO CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY TO GO TO THAT RECITAL, THAT HE HAD COME INTO PAUL REVERE AT FIVE O'CLOCK AND SAW HIS EX-WIFE AND HE HAD TO GET HIS TICKET AND TAKE HIS TICKET BACK TO THE PERSON AT THE DOOR, THAT HIS DAUGHTER WAS 30 OF SOMETHING ON THE PROGRAM, AND YOU HAVE BEEN TO PROGRAMS WHERE THE CHILD IS GOING TO COME UP AND THERE IS PROBABLY A HUNDRED PEOPLE THERE AND YOUR CHILD IS 99TH AND SHE WAS LIKE 30 SOMETHING, AND SHE WAS AT THE VERY END, AND AS A PARENT YOU SIT THERE AND YOU ARE REALLY PROUD OF THE YOUNGSTERS AND YOU DO THAT.AS THE PROGRAM WAS GOING HE REMEMBERED THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY FLOWERS WHEN HE FIRST GOT THERE AND HE WAS SITTING -- HE WAS TWO SEATS AWAY FROM HIS EX-WIFE, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON. HE WASN'T STARING AT ANYBODY. HE WASN'T GLARING AT ANYBODY. HE WASN'T JEALOUS ABOUT ANYTHING.IN FACT, YOU WILL HEAR THE CONVERSATION THAT HE HAD WITH RON GOLDMAN. HE WAS STILL IN THE GROUP, THERE WAS A GROUP OF THEM WHO RAN AROUND TOGETHER IN BRENTWOOD, AND O.J. SIMPSON WAS COMMISERATING WITH RON GOLDMAN ABOUT HIS PROBLEMS HE WAS HAVING.PLEASE FORGIVE ME. RON FICHMAN, EXCUSE ME. I HEARD THOSE SOUNDS, I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT. RON FICHMAN, HE IS THE MAN WHO TOOK THIS PICTURE HERE.HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HIS PROBLEMS WITH CORA FICHMAN AND THE GROUP THAT RAN AROUND TOGETHER. THE TESTIMONY WILL BE THAT HE WAS SAYING I'M GLAD TO BE OUT OF IT, I'M BACK WITH PAULA. AND WAS HE BACK WITH PAULA? YES, HE IS BACK WITH PAULA.THE NIGHT BEFORE -- BEFORE THIS TRIAL IS OVER, WE WILL HAVE ANOTHER PICTURE, BUT THIS PICTURE WILL DO FOR NOW.BY THE WAY, MR. DOUGLAS IS GOING TO HELP US BECAUSE THERE ARE GRAPHICS AND THINGS. I HOPE YOU WILL BEAR WITH US.THANK YOU, MR. DOUGLAS.YOUR HONOR, YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY SEEN THIS PICTURE.

#MR. COCHRAN: ,"THEN THIS IS THEN 201 AND NO. 201 IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF O.J. SIMPSON.THIS PHOTOGRAPH, THERE WILL BE TESTIMONY, WAS TAKEN ON JUNE 11, ON SATURDAY JUNE 11. THAT IS A CHARITABLE FUND-RAISER, I THINK $25,000, BY THE WAY, FOR THE BENEFIT OF ISRAEL AND THAT IS O.J. SIMPSON THERE.AND ON THAT NIGHT, SATURDAY JUNE 11, HE WENT WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND, PAULA BARBIERI, WHO HAD PICKED HIM UP AT THE AIRPORT ON FRIDAY EVENING, JUNE 10TH, WHEN HE CAME BACK FROM WORKING IN THE EAST FROM NEW YORK AND THEY SPENT THAT TIME TOGETHER AND THEY WENT OUT SATURDAY EVENING.SO THIS PICTURE AGAIN IS GRAPHIC EVIDENCE OF O.J. SIMPSON AND WHO HE REALLY IS. IT SEEMS TO US AS I SAID, THERE IS ANOTHER PICTURE OF PAULA BARBIERI WITH HIM THERE THAT WE DON'T HAVE YET, BUT WE WILL.NOW, MR. DARDEN TALKED A LOT ABOUT MISS SIMPSON BEING WEAK AND THAT HE EXERCISED ALL THIS CONTROL OVER HER AND PICKED HER FRIENDS.THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON IS A VERY STRONG INDEPENDENT WOMAN, VERY ATTRACTIVE AND A WONDERFUL WOMAN, AND THE ONE THING THEY NEVER HAD ARGUMENTS ABOUT WERE THOSE BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN, AND THEY BOTH LOVED THOSE BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN, AND THAT WAS VERY, VERY IMPORTANT, IT SEEMS, TO BOTH OF THEM.THAT SHE PICKED AND CHOSE HER OWN FRIENDS, THAT O.J. SIMPSON OR NO ONE ELSE COULD TELL HER WHO HER FRIENDS WERE TO BE. SHE HAD WHATEVER FRIENDS SHE WANTED, SHE DID WHATEVER SHE WANTED.HE TELLS YOU ABOUT TWO INCIDENTS WHERE HE ALLEGES THERE IS STALKING.LET ME TELL YOU THE FACTS AND THE TRUE FACTS ABOUT THOSE INCIDENTS BACKED UP WITH WITNESSES.THERE IS A MAN IN LOS ANGELES NAMED JOE STELLINI WHO OWNS A RESTAURANT ON THE WEST SIDE OUT ON PICO, HE'S A GOOD FRIEND OF O.J. SIMPSON'S, AND THEY WENT OUT TO DINNER ONE NIGHT AND WHILE OUT TO DINNER THEY BECAME AWARE OF MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON IN THEIR PARTY. THIS IS A TIME WHEN THEY WERE SEPARATED. AND THEY HAD AN AGREEMENT GENERALLY THAT IF ONE OR THE OTHER CAME IN WHILE THEY WERE THERE, THE PERSON WHO WAS THERE FIRST WOULD LEAVE OR WHATEVER, THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY PROBLEMS.THE INCIDENT REGARDING JOE STELLINI HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON OR HER PARTY. HE WAS OUT TO DINNER. THEY MIGHT FREQUENT THE SAME KIND OF PLACES. YOU WILL HEAR FROM JOE STELLINI AND YOU WILL SEE THERE IS NOT ANY INCIDENT ABOUT ANY STALKING.THE OTHER INCIDENT WAS ABOUT MEZZALUNA. I BELIEVE THERE WAS AN INCIDENT WHERE THEY WERE BOTH AT THIS RESTAURANT, MRS. SIMPSON'S PARTY HAD ALREADY BEEN SEATED WHEN HE CAME IN, AND AGAIN YOU WILL HEAR FROM THESE PARTIES WHO WILL TELL YOU THAT THESE WERE NOT ANY STALKING INCIDENTS.IF YOU LIVE IN BRENTWOOD AND THERE ARE RESTAURANTS IN THAT AREA AND YOU GO OUT TO DINNER A LOT, YOU ARE GOING TO RUN INTO EACH OTHER. AND THERE WAS NO HOSTILITY, NO STALKING, NO JEALOUSY, NO NOTHING.AND SO HE TRIES TO PAINT O.J. SIMPSON AS A JEALOUS MAN.LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THE EVIDENCE IS GOING TO BE ABOUT THAT.YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS INCIDENT OF KEITH ZLOMSOWITCH, I'M SURE, WHO IS A WITNESS WHO IS GOING TO BE CALLED. MR. DARDEN DESCRIBED IT. AND REMEMBER HE SAID YESTERDAY, WELL, HE DIDN'T PUNCH OUT NICOLE AND HE DIDN'T PUNCH OUT KEITH, OR WORDS TO THAT EFFECT. HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T.WHAT HAPPENED WAS MR. SIMPSON, IN ONE OF THESE INCIDENTS, HAD SEEN HIS EX-WIFE OUT, THEY WENT OUT DANCING AFTERWARD, AND HE STOPPED BY HER HOUSE AFTERWARDS TO TRY TO TALK TO HER. HE WOULD GO BY ON OCCASION.AND THE EVIDENCE WILL BE THAT WHEN THEY FIRST BROKE UP, HE IS ADVISED IN JANUARY OF 1992 THAT SHE WANTED A DIVORCE. IN JANUARY AND APRIL OF 1992 IT WAS HARD ON HIM. HE HAD KNOWN SOMEBODY FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE HER. HE LIKES FAMILY. HE LEARNED THAT FROM HIS MOTHER AND HE LIKES THAT. HE HAS THIS FAMILY AND HE LOVES HIS CHILDREN AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE HIS WIFE.BUT SOMETHING HAPPENED IN APRIL OF 1992, AS SOON AS THAT HE BECAME AWARE THAT SHE HAD A BOYFRIEND, FROM THAT POINT ON HIS INTERESTS CHANGED AND HE WENT ON, AND WHEN HE SAW WHAT HE SAW WITH KEITH AND MRS. SIMPSON, HE THEN WENT ON WITH HIS LIFE WITH PAULA. THAT IS WHEN IT STARTED, IN APRIL OF 1992.AND SO WHAT HAPPENED WAS HE WASN'T PEERING IN ANY WINDOWS. HE CAME TO THE FRONT DOOR TO TRY TO SEE HIS WIFE AND HE LOOKED IN AND HE SAW HIS WIFE MAKING LOVE TO A GENTLEMAN ON THAT COUCH.NOW, ACCORDING TO CHRIS DARDEN, WOULDN'T YOU EXPECT THAT HE WOULD JUST BLOW UP, BECOME BALLISTIC? HE WENT HOME, THE EVIDENCE WILL BE, HE CAME BACK THE NEXT DAY TO TALK TO MRS. SIMPSON ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE KIDS WERE UPSTAIRS AND WHAT HE SAW THEM DOING HE DIDN'T THINK WOULD BE APPROPRIATE IF ONE OF THE KIDS CAME DOWNSTAIRS.SO WHEN HE CAME BACK ON THE NEXT DAY OF THIS INCIDENT HE SAW KEITH I THINK SITTING ASTRIDE MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, GIVING HER A MASSAGE OR SOMETHING IN HER SHOULDERS. O.J. SIMPSON TALKED TO BOTH OF THEM, SHOOK KEITH'S HAND, WENT ON HIS WAY AND SAID ESSENTIALLY, LOOK, I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD BE DOING THIS IN FRONT OF THE KIDS OR WHATEVER.THEY DIDN'T TELL YOU THAT KEITH ZLOMSOWITCH MOVED IN WITH NICOLE THAT SUMMER, BUT O.J. SIMPSON WAS BACK WITH PAULA. IT DIDN'T BOTHER HIM. HE KNEW SHE WAS THERE, THAT KEITH WAS THERE.WAS HE STALKING? WAS HE JEALOUS? WAS THAT A RAGE? I THINK NOT.SO AGAIN, I WANT YOU TO TAKE THESE FACTS AND LOOK AT THEM.BUT THERE IS AN EVEN MORE PAINFUL INCIDENT PROBABLY THAT TELLS YOU THAT HE IS NOT JEALOUS.HE HAS A VERY CLOSE FRIEND, SOMEBODY WHO IS VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO HIM, THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW, WHO HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON BECAUSE SHE TOLD HIM SO WHEN THEY GOT BACK TOGETHER, AND THIS GENTLEMAN TOLD HIM SO, AND IT WAS HURTFUL, BUT HE NEVER SAID A HARSH WORD TO HER OR THIS GENTLEMAN. HE DIDN'T GO BALLISTIC, HE DIDN'T DO ANY OF THESE THINGS.IN FACT, YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID? HE LET THIS GENTLEMAN GET MARRIED AT HIS ROCKINGHAM HOUSE AFTER LEARNING THAT THIS GENTLEMAN HAD BEEN INTIMATE WITH HIS WIFE. THAT IS WHAT O.J. SIMPSON DID ON THAT OCCASION.YOUR HONOR, MAY I APPROACH A MINUTE?HELD IN OPEN COURT:)

#MR. COCHRAN: ,"THANK YOU VERY MUCH, YOUR HONOR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.I WANTED TO TRY AND PICK UP WHERE WE LEFT OFF.TO CONCLUDE THOSE REMARKS ABOUT THIS FRIEND, I THINK THAT SPEAKS VOLUMES ABOUT MR. SIMPSON'S STABILITY, HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS EX-WIFE.I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL ALSO SHOW THAT IN ABOUT MAY OF 1992 MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON CAME OVER TO THE ROCKINGHAM HOUSE AND SAID SHE HAD FOUND A BOYFRIEND, SOMEBODY DIFFERENT THAN KEITH WHERE THE INCIDENT WAS APRIL OF 1992, AND ASKED MR. SIMPSON FOR SOME ADVICE. HE OF COURSE KNEW AT THAT POINT THAT IT WAS OVER AND HE WAS BACK WITH PAULA AND WENT ON WITH HIS LIFE, AS I SAID, UNTIL SUCH TIME AS IN 1993 SHE DECIDED SHE WANTED TO GET BACK TOGETHER AT THAT POINT.NOW, TO CLEAR UP -- I WANT TO ALWAYS KEEP THE FAITH WITH YOU ABOUT BEING AS ACCURATE AS I CAN. THE TWO INCIDENTS THAT THEY TALKED ABOUT, THE ONE INCIDENT INVOLVING THE MAN JOE STELLINI WAS AT MEZZALUNA AND THE OTHER INCIDENT WAS A RESTAURANT CALLED TRYST AND IN BOTH INCIDENTS THERE WAS NO PROBLEM, NO FIGHT, AND IN FACT AT THE TRYST INCIDENT I BELIEVE IT WAS -- MEZZALUNA INCIDENT -- MR. SIMPSON WENT HOME WITH HIS WIFE THAT NIGHT, SO THAT THIS WAS NOT ANY INCIDENT WHERE THEY WERE STALKING OR FIGHTING, ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THERE WAS NO OBSESSIVE BEHAVIOR.I HOPE TO PUT THOSE IN SOME KIND OF PERSPECTIVE.MR. DARDEN TALKED IN HIS OPENING STATEMENT ABOUT APRIL, 1985, INCIDENT IN WHICH SOME DAMAGE WAS DONE TO A VEHICLE, AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT, THE TESTIMONY WILL BE THAT WAS NOT ANY INCIDENT IN 1985 BECAUSE MISS NICOLE WAS PREGNANT, HAD A C-SECTION LATER IN THAT YEAR AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY SITUATION LIKE THAT.THEY DID HAVE SOME DISCUSSION APPARENTLY MAYBE IN '86 OR IN '84, SOME DAMAGE DONE TO A CAR AND SHE WAS NOT IN THAT CAR. SHE WAS NOT STRUCK ON THAT OCCASION, SO I THINK YOU WILL FIND THAT INCIDENT OF NOT GREAT CONSEQUENCE.MR. DARDEN TALKED ABOUT THE 1993 911 TAPE THAT YOU'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT AND I THINK EVEN HE CONCEDED YESTERDAY THAT IN THAT SITUATION, ALTHOUGH YOU COULD HEAR MR. SIMPSON'S VOICE, HE WAS ANGRY, MR. SIMPSON NEVER LAID A HAND ON HIS WIFE, NEVER CALLED HER A NAME.AND I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT A TRIAL IS THAT FINALLY YOU ARE GOING TO GET TO HEAR ALL OF THIS TAPE AND WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO HEAR, MR. DARDEN DIDN'T TELL YOU THIS YESTERDAY, IS THAT THERE WAS A DISCUSSION ON THIS 911 TAPE AND HE ALLUDED TO THE FACT THAT MR. SIMPSON COULDN'T GET OUT OF HIS MIND WHAT HE HAD SEEN BACK ON APRIL, 1992.WELL, NOW, FIRST OF ALL, MOST OF US MIGHT HAVE A PROBLEM GETTING THAT PICTURE OUT OF OUR MIND OF SEEING YOUR WIFE MAKING LOVE TO SOMEONE ELSE, BUT AT ANY RATE, THIS WASN'T THE REASON FOR THE ARGUMENT.WHAT HAD HAPPENED WAS, AND THE FACTS WILL BE, THAT WHEN THEY STARTED TRYING TO GET BACK TOGETHER AGAIN IN '93, THEY HAD AN AGREEMENT THAT THEY WOULD TAKE THE PICTURES OF THEIR BOYFRIENDS AND GIRLFRIENDS OUT OF -- PUT THEM AWAY, BASICALLY, WHICH SEEMED TO BE A REASONABLE REQUEST, AND THERE WAS A DISPUTE BECAUSE WHEN MISS BROWN SIMPSON WOULD EVER SEE PAULA BARBIERI'S PICTURE, SHE WAS VERY UPSET ABOUT THAT, AND MR. SIMPSON, ON THIS DATE, I BELIEVE, SAW A PICTURE OF SOMEBODY THAT SHE HAD DATED DURING THE TIME THEY HAD BEEN SEPARATED AND HE SAID, GEE, WHAT IS FAIR FOR ME WILL BE FAIR TO YOU AND THEY GOT INTO THIS CONVERSATION THAT WENT OVER A PERIOD OF TIME.AT SOME POINT THERE WAS JUST A VERBAL CONVERSATION, IT ESCALATED, AND TEMPERS FLARE AND THAT SOMETIMES HAPPENS WITH MARRIED COUPLES. THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT BUT SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS.HE CAME OVER TO HER HOUSE AND HE DID IN FACT KICK A FRENCH DOOR. THE EVIDENCE WILL BE THE DOOR WAS ALREADY BROKEN AND HE FIXED IT BUT HE NEVER AT ANY TIME STRUCK HIS WIFE DURING THIS PERIOD OF TIME AND WHAT HE WAS SAYING -- AT SOME POINT SHE SAYS, ""O.J., O.J., BE QUIET, WHAT ABOUT THE KIDS?""AND HE SAYS, ESSENTIALLY, ""YOU WEREN'T THINKING ABOUT THE KIDS AND BEING QUIET WHEN YOU WERE ON THE COUCH WITH KEITH.""I THINK YOU WILL HEAR THIS ON THE TAPE. SO YOU PUT IT THIS PERSPECTIVE.AND THE IMPORTANT POINT TO MAKE IS THAT NOBODY WAS EVER INJURED DURING THIS PERIOD OF TIME AND IN FACT THERE IS A TAPE-RECORDING AND A TRANSCRIPT OF SOME POLICE OFFICERS WHO CAME OUT AND TALKED WITH THESE PARTIES AND IN THAT TAPE YOU WILL GET A CHANCE TO HEAR WHAT MISS BROWN SIMPSON THOUGHT ABOUT THAT INCIDENT AND THEY ALSO TALKED TO O.J. WHO WAITED THERE FOR THEM, HE AGREED TO FIX THIS DOOR, AND THEY WENT ON WITH THEIR LIVES AND WENT ON AND CONTINUED DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME TO GET ALONG. THIS WAS A TIME THEY WERE BACK TOGETHER.YOU SHOULD NOTE THAT MR. SIMPSON, BECAUSE OF HOW HE HAS CONDUCTED HIS LIFE AND THE THINGS HE HAS DONE IN HIS LIFE, HAS BEEN ABLE TO AMASS SOME ASSETS. NOT BAD FOR A YOUNG MAN, A SPINDLY LEG YOUTH FROM SAN FRANCISCO WHO SUFFERED WITH RICKETS, WHO HAD TROUBLE WALKING, WAS CARED FOR BY HIS MOTHER, WHO GREW UP TO BECOME THE GREATEST RUNNING BACK IN THE HISTORY OF THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE.AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT AND HIS COMMERCIAL ENDORSEMENTS AND THINGS, HE IS ABLE TO HAVE SEVERAL HOMES. HE HAS A HOME IN NEW YORK, AND THE EVIDENCE WILL BE THAT IN AUGUST OF EACH YEAR, BECAUSE OF HIS COMMITMENTS WITH NBC, HE WOULD GO AND LIVE IN NEW YORK. HE WOULDN'T TRY TO CONTROL MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON. SHE WOULD DO WHAT SHE WANTED HERE. EVEN DURING '93 HE WAS LIVING IN NEW YORK FROM AUGUST TO JANUARY, MAYBE AFTER THE SUPERBOWL, FROM AUGUST TO JANUARY HE WOULD BE BACK THERE AT HIS NEW YORK HOUSE.HE ALSO HAD A HOUSE IN LAGUNA BEACH IN ORANGE COUNTY AND THE ONE THING THAT I FORGOT TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE CIRCLE OF BENEVOLENCE, HE ASSISTED HIS WIFE IN BUYING A CONDO IN LAGUNA FOR HERSELF SEPARATE FROM HER HOUSE, SO WHEN SHE WAS AT ROCKINGHAM SHE HAD TWO CONDOS IN HER OWN NAME, ONE IN LAGUNA, ONE IN SAN FRANCISCO SHE IS GETTING MONEY FROM AND LIVING IN ROCKINGHAM.THEY DIDN'T TELL YOU ABOUT THAT.HE ALSO HAD BOUGHT SOME PROPERTY IN CABO SAN LUCAS WHERE HE HAD PLANNED TO BUILD.ALL OF THE THINGS THAT HE WAS DOING WAS ABOUT THE FAMILY, KEEPING THE FAMILY TOGETHER, DOING THINGS WITH IN-LAWS AND WITH FRIENDS AND WITH THE CHILDREN, SO I THINK YOU WILL HEAR EVIDENCE ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE WAS AWAY GREAT PERIODS OF TIME.AND WHILE I'M ABOUT THAT, LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE KIND OF SCHEDULE THIS MAN HAD.YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE HIS CALENDAR YET, BUT AT SOME POINT HOPEFULLY WE WILL. IF YOU WENT BACK AND LOOKED AT MR. O.J. SIMPSON'S DAILY CALENDAR FROM JANUARY TO JUNE OF 1994, YOU WOULD FIND A MAN THAT IN JANUARY WAS OUT OF TOWN AND PROBABLY STILL LIVING IN NEW YORK ALMOST EVERY DAY, BUT HE WAS OUT OF NEW YORK BECAUSE HE WAS TRAVELING.SOME OF WHO KNOW THIS IS SUPERBOWL WEEK, YOU CAN IMAGINE HE WAS IN ATLANTA THAT WEEK BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE THE SUPERBOWL WAS LAST YEAR. THE EVIDENCE WILL BE THAT THIS WAS A TIME THAT HE AND HIS WIFE WERE TRYING TO MAKE IT, THAT HE TOOK SOME FAMILY MEMBERS, THE BROWNS FROM GERMANY, TO THE SUPERBOWL IN ATLANTA, PAID FOR ALL OF THEM, GOT THEM 50-YARD SEATS AND TOOK THEM TO ALL THE BIG PARTIES THAT WERE GOING ON THIS WEEK.HE WAS AGAIN OUT OF TOWN DURING ALL OF THAT PARTICULAR MONTH.IF YOU LOOK AT HIS CALENDAR, AND THERE WILL BE TESTIMONY, THAT IN FEBRUARY HE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN CABO SAN LUCAS, HE WAS THIS NASHVILLE, INST. LOUIS, IN MIAMI, IN MIAMI AGAIN INVOLVED IN CHARITABLE WORK. FEW DAYS WILL YOU FIND HE WAS HE HERE IN LOS ANGELES.IF YOU LOOKED AT MARCH YOU WILL FIND THAT HE WAS IN NEW YORK, HE WAS DOING BRYANT GUMBLE'S CHARITABLE GOLF TOURNAMENT IN ORLANDO, FLORIDA. BACK IN NEW YORK AGAIN. HE WAS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY DOING VARIOUS AND SUNDRY THINGS.YOU GOT TO THE MONTH OF APRIL, HE WAS BACK IN CABO. FROM THERE HE CAME BACK TO LOS ANGELES. THEN HE WENT TO PUERTO RICO. THE EVIDENCE WILL BE THAT AS SOME YOU KNOW, HE IS AN ACTOR, A WOULD-BE ACTOR, AND THAT HE MADE THIS MOVIE FROGMAN DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME IN PUERTO RICO, AGAIN VERY MUCH OUT OF CALIFORNIA.AND IN MAY, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SOME THINGS THAT HE CAME TO DO FOR HIS CHILDREN -- AND BY THE WAY, AGAIN TALKING ABOUT THE KIND OF THINGS THAT HE WOULD DO AT ROCKINGHAM -- AND YOU WILL SEE THIS PLACE AT ROCKINGHAM -- ON MAY 22ND HE HAD A SCHOOL PICNIC AT ROCKINGHAM. HE HAD A NUMBER OF KIDS -- AND I THINK THAT IS FOR THE SUNSHINE PRESCHOOL. THAT IS WHERE HIS SON JUSTIN WENT. IT WAS A FUND-RAISER FOR THIS SCHOOL AND THEY HAVE ALL THESE KIDS AND ALL THE PEOPLE WOULD COME TO HIS HOUSE AT ROCKINGHAM TO RAISE MONEY FOR THE SCHOOL.ON MAY 22ND HE DID THAT AND NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON WAS THERE, AND EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD AGREED IN MAY, EARLIER THAT MONTH IN MAY AND HE WAS NOW BACK WITH PAULA, WHEN NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON GOT SICK THE WEEK OF MAY 15, 1994, SHE HAD PNEUMONIA, O.J. SIMPSON WAS THE ONE THAT TOOK HER SOUP AND TRIED TO NURSE HER BACK TO GET HER BACK ON HER FEET EVEN THOUGH THEY AGREED THEY WEREN'T GOING TO BE TOGETHER ANY MORE.YOU HEARD TESTIMONY WITH REGARD TO THAT AND HE CONTINUED OF COURSE BEING IN AND OUT OF TOWN.IN JUNE OF 1994 HE HAD HAD AND HAD TAKEN HIS TWO CHILDREN, SYDNEY AND JUSTIN -- AND LET ME SAY SOMETHING AT THIS POINT. MR. SIMPSON HAS TWO OTHER CHILDREN THAT HE'S EQUALLY PROUD OF. THE MINORS CANNOT BE HERE OBVIOUSLY FOR OBVIOUS REASONS, BUT HE HAS TWO OTHER CHILDREN THAT HE'S EQUALLY PROUD OF AND THEY ARE HERE IN COURT TODAY AND THERE IS ARNELLE SIMPSON OVER THERE AND JASON SIMPSON SITTING BETWEEN HIS TWO SISTERS, CARMEN DURIO AND MISS SHIRLEY BAKER, AND THE BALANCE OF THE FAMILY, AND YOU HAVE MET MISS EUNICE SIMPSON ALREADY.SO HE ON MAY 5TH ATTENDED A PEDIATRICS AIDS AFFAIR, AGAIN HIS INTEREST IN CHILDREN AND AIDS AND CHARITABLE WORK, ALONG WITH PAULA AND HE TOOK THE TWO YOUNGER CHILDREN, A REAL FINE DAY, AND THAT WAS ON THAT SUNDAY.ON THAT TUESDAY HE LEFT TO GO TO WASHINGTON D.C. AGAIN HE LEFT TOWN, HE HAD TO WORK. ON WEDNESDAY HE WAS WORKING FOR HERTZ IN WASHINGTON D.C. ON THURSDAY HE IS IN CONNECTICUT WORKING AGAIN AT ONE OF HIS BOARD MEETINGS, HE IS ON THESE VARIOUS BOARDS, SOME CHARITABLE, SOME PROFITABLE, HOPEFULLY. HE WAS IN CONNECTICUT.ON FRIDAY -- THURSDAY NIGHT HE WAS IN NEW YORK WITH HIS FRIEND BENDER AND HE HAD WORKED AND HE WOULD TRY TO PLAY GOLF DURING THESE PERIODS OF TIME. YOU RECALL I MENTIONED THAT MR. BENDER SUGGESTED, ""YOU ARE GOING TO BE IN CHICAGO ON TUESDAY OR MONDAY NIGHT, STAY OVER."" HE CAME HOME FOR THE RECITAL.AND WHEN YOU SEE HIS CALENDAR, YOU WILL SEE, IT IS PLANNED ALL THE WAY OUT, FAR BEYOND JUNE, OF COURSE, OF 1994.BUT IT GIVES YOU A SENSE OF THIS MAN, THIS MAN'S LIFE, WHAT HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO DO WITH HIS LIFE AND WITH HIMSELF.I POINT OUT THESE THINGS TO YOU BECAUSE I THINK AS YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THE INCIDENTS THAT MR. DARDEN TALKED ABOUT, THAT PUTS THEM INTO PERSPECTIVE.THIS IS NOT A CASE ABOUT DOMESTIC ABUSE. THIS IS A MURDER CASE. THIS IS A MURDER CASE ABOUT WHO DID THESE HORRIBLE CRIMES. THAT IS GOING TO BE YOUR DECISION, NOT TO THINK THAT O.J. SIMPSON IS A BAD GUY OR A GOOD GUY FOR THAT MATTER, BUT TO GET A PICTURE OF HIM, I THINK THAT YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME THAT AFTER YOU HEAR THE FACT YOU WILL HAVE A CLEARER PICTURE.NOW, ABOUT THE 19 -- WE TALKED ABOUT THE 1993 INCIDENT, I THINK WE DID, AND I THINK THAT IS -- THOSE ARE THE MAIN INCIDENTS THAT MR. DARDEN TALKED ABOUT.ONE THING I WANTED TO POINT OUT TO YOU IS THAT THERE WILL BE, I BELIEVE, TESTIMONY THAT AS THESE PARTIES GOT A DIVORCE, AS SO OFTEN HAPPENS, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON HAD HER DEPOSITION TAKEN AND SHE HAD MADE A STATEMENT DURING THAT DEPOSITION WITH REGARD TO WHETHER HE EVER PHYSICALLY STRUCK HER AFTER THE '89 INCIDENT, AND IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO HEAR WHAT THAT IS.MARK FUHRMAN BECOMES EVEN MORE RELEVANT IN THIS CASE AS WE GO ALONG AND DISCUSS IT, BECAUSE HE WAS THE OFFICER WHO SUPPOSEDLY RESPONDED, HE SAYS, IN '85. THERE IS ANOTHER INCIDENT THAT -- THE INCIDENT INVOLVING THE BAT AND MERCEDES WAS NOT IN '85 BECAUSE SHE WAS PREGNANT, BUT HE WRITES A REPORT FOUR YEARS LATER IN '89 SAYING HE HAD AN INDELIBLE IMPRESSION OF MR. O.J. SIMPSON, AND IN COMING TO THAT LOCATION, AN INDELIBLE IMPRESSION, SO WE WILL HAVE TO PURSUE THAT INCIDENT AND WHETHER OR NOT THIS REPORT HE WROTE FOUR YEARS LATER AND WHETHER OR NOT IT IS ACCURATE AND IT WAS NOT DONE CONTEMPORANEOUSLY WITH THE INCIDENT.MR. DARDEN ALSO SAYS THAT THIS WAS NOT A TABLOID PROSECUTION. THAT IS INTERESTING. HE USED THOSE WORDS, DIDN'T HE? HE SAID, FIRST OF ALL, THIS WASN'T CHARACTERIZATION ASSASSINATION AND WHICH WE NOW KNOW IT WAS, AND HE SAYS THIS IS NOT A TABLOID PROSECUTION.WELL, I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL BE THAT AFTER THIS BOOK THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT FROM HIS SO-CALLED FRIEND, FAYE RESNICK, STARTED COMING OUT, THAT IS WHEN THE PEOPLE STARTED GETTING ALL THESE WITNESSES WHO WANTED TO COME FORWARD TO TALK ABOUT THESE INCIDENTS.SO WHETHER OR NOT IT IS A TABLOID PROSECUTION IS NOT FOR ME TO SAY; IT IS GOING TO BE FOR YOU TO SAY.LET ME SAY THIS ABOUT FAYE RESNICK --

COCHRAN: ,"GOES INTO A DRUG TREATMENT FACILITY ON JUNE 8TH AND SHE REMAINS THERE AND SHE IS THERE ON JUNE 12, AND I THINK YOU WILL HEAR FROM THE EVIDENCE THAT SHE IS ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT CALLED MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON ON THE NIGHT OF JUNE 12, PERHAPS AFTER NINE O'CLOCK, THAT PARTICULAR NIGHT, FROM THIS DRUG TREATMENT FACILITY.WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THAT AND HER ROLE IN THIS WHOLE DRAMA.TO CONCLUDE THEN, WHAT I HAVE TRIED TO DO IN THIS OPENING STATEMENT, TO LAY OUT FOR YOU THE FACT THAT IN ALMOST EVERYTHING YOU HEAR IN THIS CASE THERE ARE TWO SIDES, THAT AS JURORS I'M SURE YOU ARE NOT GOING TO RUSH TO JUDGMENT, THAT THIS SHOULD NOT BE A CASE ABOUT CHARACTER ASSASSINATION.AND I HOPE YOU WILL KEEP AN OPEN MIND UNTIL YOU HEAR ALL OF THE EVIDENCE AS IT RELATES TO WHO MR. SIMPSON IS.NOW, SHIFTING OUR ATTENTION NOW TO THE DISCUSSION, AND A VERY ABLE DISCUSSION OF MISS MARCIA CLARK YESTERDAY, IT SEEMED TO ME, AS YOU SUMMARIZED WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY TO YOU, THAT HER ARGUMENT BROKE DOWN OR -- WELL, IT WAS ARGUMENT AT THE END -- BUT HER OPENING STATEMENT BROKE DOWN INTO A DISCUSSION OF TIMELINE AND SO-CALLED EVIDENCE TRAILS.LET ME, FIRST OF ALL, TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF THE TIMELINE. WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- AND LET ME TELL YOU WHAT SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU ABOUT. SOME OF THIS WE COVERED SO I WON'T BE REDUNDANT, BUT THERE ARE WITNESSES LIKE THE LADY WHO LIVED NEXT DOOR TO MR. SIMPSON.THERE IS A MR. TOM LANG THAT SHE KNOWS ABOUT AND DIDN'T TELL YOU ABOUT WHO ON THIS PARTICULAR NIGHT, JUNE 12, 1994, WAS WALKING HIS DOG ON THE STREET CALLED DOROTHY STREET RIGHT DOWN THE WAY FROM MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S CONDO AT 875.THAT FROM HIS VANTAGE POINT JUST A SHORT DISTANCE ON THE CORNER HE LOOKED UP AND HE SAW A LADY THAT HE BELIEVED WAS MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON EMBRACING SOMEONE AT A VEHICLE AT THE CURB AND BEHIND MISS SIMPSON HE SAW A MAN THAT HE DESCRIBED AS HISPANIC OR CAUCASIAN STANDING WITH HIS HANDS CLENCHED STANDING THERE LOOKING AS THOUGH HE WAS ANGRY.AND HE DIDN'T KNOW WHY THIS MAN WAS LOOKING LIKE THIS, AND THIS IS ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK ON JUNE 12, WHETHER HE WAS ANGRY -- MR. LANG DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER HE WAS ANGRY BECAUSE HIS DOG WAS LOOSE OR WHAT, BUT AGAIN, THIS IS WHAT I EXPECT HIS TESTIMONY TO BE, THIS IS AT TEN O'CLOCK, AND HE SEES A LADY THAT HE BELIEVES IS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON AT THAT POINT.I TALKED TO YOU BRIEFLY BEFORE ABOUT ELLEN ARRONSON AND DAN MANDEL WHO SHE DIDN'T TALKTO -- SHE HAS TALKED TO THEM BUT SHE DIDN'T TALK TO THEM YESTERDAY -- AS THEY WALK PAST THIS PLACE RIGHT AT ABOUT 10:25 OR THEREABOUTS.AND THERE IS ANOTHER WITNESS WHOSE NAME IS ROBERT HEIDSTRA AND ROBERT HEIDSTRA IS IN AN ALLEY ONE STREET OVER, BUT WHEN YOU GO OUT THERE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE HOW WELL YOU CAN HEAR LATE AT NIGHT, ESPECIALLY ON A SUNDAY NIGHT, AT THIS LOCATION.MR. HEIDSTRA, ACCORDING TO HIS STATEMENTS, IS WALKING IN THIS ALLEY. NOW IT IS ABOUT 10:35 OR 10:40. AS HE WALKS PARALLEL TO WHERE THE BUNDY RESIDENCE IS, HE WILL BE THEN LOOKING WEST, HE HEARS SOUND OF LIKE ARGUING AND HE HEARS SOMEONE OR A VOICE SAY, ""HEY, HEY, HEY,"" AND HE HEARS THE SOUND OF A FENCE CLOSING AND HE CONTINUES ON WALKING HIS DOG.NOW, THIS IS AT 10:40 OR THEREABOUTS AND YOU KNOW THEN AT 10:45 MARYANNE GERCHAS SEES THESE FOUR MEN RUNNING FROM 875 DOWN TOWARD HER DIRECTION AND SHE BELIEVES THEY ARE COMING AFTER HER AT THAT POINT.IN HER STATEMENT TO YOU YESTERDAY MISS CLARK TALKED TO YOU A LOT ABOUT ALLAN PARK AND I READ YOU SOME OF HIS TRANSCRIPTS, SOME OF HIS TESTIMONY THAT YOU DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT, AND I THINK THERE WILL BE CONSIDERABLY MORE WITH REGARD TO MR. PARK.AND MR. KATO, KATO KAELIN, AN INTERESTING MAN, AND I THINK THAT IT WILL BE INTERESTING WHEN YOU HEAR FROM MR. KATO KAELIN ABOUT MR. SIMPSON AND HOW HE APPEARED THAT NIGHT.JUST BEFORE WE WRAP UP FOR LUNCH, I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW YOU THAT IN ORDER TO BELIEVE THAT O.J. SIMPSON COMMITTED THESE HORRIBLE MURDERS, YOU WOULD HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT HE CAME BACK FROM BACK EAST WHERE HE HAD BEEN WORKING TO COME TO HIS DAUGHTER'S RECITAL, ATTENDED THAT RECITAL. YOU SEE HIS PICTURE THERE.HE WAS HOME GETTING READY FOR A TRIP TO CHICAGO THAT HAD BEEN LONG PRE-PLANNED, THAT HE WAS HUNGRY, AND THE EVIDENCE WILL BE THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY DOLLAR BILLS OR $20.00 BILLS, THAT HE ASKED TO BORROW SOME MONEY FROM KATO KAELIN. KATO KAELIN GAVE HIM THIS MONEY AND HE WENT AND HAD A BIG MAC.YOU WOULD HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS PLANNING TO KILL HIS WIFE EITHER BEFORE HE GOT THIS BIG MAC OR THEN WENT AND GOT THE BIG MAC, BUT KATO KAELIN WILL DESCRIBE THAT HE WAS DRESSED IN SOME KIND OF SWEAT CLOTHES AND SOME TENNIS SHOES.THAT IF YOU FOLLOW THE PEOPLE'S CASE YOU WOULD HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT HE THEN CAME HOME AND SAID, GEE, I THINK WHAT I WILL DO IS I WILL GO OVER AND KILL MY WIFE NOW AND I THINK I WILL TAKE THESE TENNIS SHOES OFF AND PUT ON SOME DRESS SHOES, SOME HARD-SOLED SHOES AND CHANGE CLOTHES KNOWING HE IS GOING TO BE LEAVING SHORTLY TO GO TO THE AIRPORT, AND THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT TO BELIEVE THEIR THEORY AND TO MAKE THEIR THEORY WORK THEY SPENT ALL THIS TIME TALKING ABOUT THE PLAINTIVE WAIL OF A DOG BECAUSE THEY HAVE GOT TO MAKE THIS AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE AT 10:15.WE KNOW THAT THAT IS NOT CORRECT BASED UPON THE FACTS THAT YOU'VE HEARD.TO CONCLUDE, ISN'T IT INTERESTING THAT IN ALL OF THE DISCUSSION YESTERDAY BY THESE TWO VERY EXCELLENT LAWYERS THEY NEVER ONCE MENTIONED THEIR CORONER, DR. GOLDEN. HE IS ANOTHER MYSTERIOUS MYSTERY WITNESS THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT.AND WHEN WE COME BACK THIS AFTERNOON, LET'S TALK ABOUT WHY THE PROSECUTION DOESN'T WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT DR. GOLDEN AND LET'S TALK ABOUT WHEN MISS CLARK SAYS, WELL, YOU CAN'T REALLY FIX THE TIME OF DEATH HERE WITH ANY PRECISION.WE WILL HAVE TESTIMONY FROM ONE OF THE LEADING PATHOLOGISTS IN THE UNITED STATES, MICHAEL BADEN, WHO HAS ALSO WORKED FOR THE L.A. COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WHO WAS WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT JOHN BELUSHI'S DEATH. HE WAS ABLE TO PINPOINT THE TIME OF DEATH TO WITHIN ONE HOUR, AND YET IN THIS CASE BECAUSE THE CORONER WAS NOT CALLED FOR TEN HOURS AFTER THESE BODIES WERE FOUND, OR EIGHT HOURS, AND THEY GOT OUT THERE AFTER ABOUT TEN HOURS, VIOLATING THE STATE LAW.WE ARE PRECLUDED FROM PINPOINTING THIS AND THEY HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT IT IS ABOUT A DOG'S WAIL WHEN A MAN'S LIFE IS AT STAKE.WE WILL PICK UP AFTER LUNCH, YOUR HONOR.

#MR. COCHRAN: ,"WHEN WE BROKE THIS MORNING, WE HAD JUST GOTTEN TO THE POINT OF DISCUSSING THE CORONER WHO PREVIOUSLY TESTIFIED IN THIS MATTER, DR. GOLDEN; AND I THINK I ALLUDED TO THE FACT THAT, IN THE COURSE OF THE OPENING STATEMENT YESTERDAY, WE DIDN'T HEAR HIS NAME. AND WE EXPECT THAT HE WILL IN FACT BE CALLED IN THIS CASE EITHER -- IF THE PEOPLE DON'T CALL HIM, WE WILL.AND I THINK YOU WILL HEAR EVIDENCE TO THE EFFECT THAT YOU CAN IN FACT DETERMINE THE TIME OF DEATH WITH GREATER PRECISION THAN YOU HEARD YESTERDAY. THAT IF ONE IS QUALIFIED, ONE CAN LOOK AT THE STATE OF RIGOR MORTIS, STATE OF LIVIDITY OF THE BODY, STATE OF THE TEMPERATURE OF THE BODY AND ALSO THE AMBIENT TEMPERATURE, USE THINGS LIKE THE STOMACH CONTENTS.IN THIS CASE, THERE WAS A MAJOR PROBLEM. DR. GOLDEN'S TESTIMONY IS THAT HE WOULD PLACE THE TIME OF DEATH BETWEEN 9:00 AND 12:00 O'CLOCK.NOW, BETWEEN 9:00 AND 12:00 O'CLOCK, YOU NOW HAVE HEARD ENOUGH OF THE EVIDENCE TO UNDERSTAND THAT 12:00 O'CLOCK, MR. SIMPSON WAS IN THE AIR. AT 9:00 O'CLOCK, THERE WILL BE TESTIMONY, AS YOU'VE HEARD, AS TO WHERE HE WAS AT HIS HOUSE.SO WE ARE -- WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH REGARD TO TRYING TO FIX THE TIME OF DEATH. AND YOU HEARD THE PROSECUTION'S THEORY YESTERDAY ABOUT THE TIME OF DEATH BEING ABOUT 10:15. YOU'VE HEARD FROM ME THIS MORNING THAT THE DEFENSE ADVANCES THE THEORY THAT THAT'S CLEARLY WRONG BASED UPON THE WITNESSES THAT YOU'VE HEARD.NOW, WITH REGARD TO DR. BADIN, WHO IS OUR EXPERT -- AND I SHOULD TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HIM.DR. MICHAEL BADIN IS A FORMER FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST, THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER FOR THE CITY OF NEW YORK. HE RESIDES IN NEW YORK.AS I SAID, HE HAS WORKED FOR THE L.A. COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN THE PAST. HE'S CONSIDERED ONE OF THE FOREMOST FORENSIC PATHOLOGISTS IN AMERICA.HE CAME TO -- THE EVIDENCE WILL BE THAT HE CAME TO LOS ANGELES SHORTLY AFTER MR. SIMPSON'S RETURN FROM CHICAGO AND IN FACT WENT TO THE L.A. COUNTY CORONER'S OFFICE THAT WEEK, THE WEEK OF JUNE 13TH.AND IT WAS AFTER DR. MICHAEL BADIN'S CONFERENCES WITH DR. GOLDEN AND HIS SUPERIOR ALONG WITH DR. BADIN'S COLLEAGUE, DR. BARBARA WOLF, THAT THE CORONER'S OFFICE WROTE A LETTER TO MR. HODGMAN WITH AN AMENDMENT TO THE CORONER'S REPORT THEY FILED.AND I WOULD LIKE AT THIS TIME TO TURN OUR ATTENTION TO THE GRAPHICS.THIS IS A LETTER THAT IS DIRECTED TO OUR COLLEAGUE, MR.

#MR. COCHRAN: ,"THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.THANK YOU, MR. HARRIS. WE FINISHED THAT ONE.NOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AS I INDICATED TO YOU, WHAT YOU'VE JUST SEEN AND WHAT WE EXPECT TO BE THE EVIDENCE IS THAT THOSE ARE BASICALLY AMENDMENTS TO THE CORONER'S REPORT BROUGHT ABOUT AFTER THIS CONVERSATION AND MEETING BETWEEN THE L.A. COUNTY CORONER, WHO DID THE AUTOPSY HERE, DR. GOLDEN, HIS BOSS, DR. LAKSHMANAN, AND THEN OUR EXPERTS.NOW, WE EXPECT THAT WHEN DR. BADIN IS CALLED TO TESTIFY IN THIS CASE, HE'LL MAKE A NUMBER OF FINDINGS BECAUSE HE WAS THERE, HE WAS ABLE TO REVIEW ALL THESE RECORDS. AND WE EXPECT THE EVIDENCE TO SHOW -- WHILE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT CORONERS -- THAT HE WILL TESTIFY THAT THE INJURIES AND BRUISES ON MR. RONALD GOLDMAN'S HANDS INDICATE THAT HE HAD STRUCK HIS ASSAILANT, AND YET THERE -- AND THERE WAS A FIGHT, A MAJOR FIGHT PRIOR TO HIS DEATH, THAT PROPER FORENSIC PROCEDURES WERE TO PRESERVE THE STOMACH CONTENTS OF THE DECEASED, AS I INDICATED TO YOU.THAT IN THIS CASE, THERE WAS NO RAPE OR SEMEN KIT ANALYSIS PERFORMED. AND WE WOULD EXPECT THAT HE WOULD -- THE EXPERT WOULD TESTIFY THAT A SEMEN RAPE KIT ANALYSIS IS STANDARD PROCEDURE FOR CORONER'S OFFICES IN THE UNITED STATES AT THIS TIME IN JUNE OF 1994.HE WILL ALSO TESTIFY I BELIEVE THAT THE CLOSER TO THE TIME OF DEATH ONE TAKES THE TEMPERATURE OF A VICTIM, THE LIVER MORTIS AND THEIR RIGOR MORTIS, THE LIKELIHOOD OF AN ACCURATE RESULT INCREASES. AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT.HE WILL SAY ALSO I BELIEVE THAT THE KILLINGS WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF LOSS OF BLOOD. AND OF COURSE, YOU'VE SEEN THAT. THAT EVIDENCE OF WHICH WOULD BE EXPECTED TO BE ON THE PERPETRATOR AND WOULD HAVE EXPECTED THE PERSON WHO COMMITTED THESE HORRIBLE CRIMES WOULD BE COVERED WITH BLOOD.DR. BADIN, ALONG WITH HIS COLLEAGUE ALSO, DR. WOLF, EXAMINED HISTOLOGY SAMPLES AND POINTED OUT TO THE CORONER'S OFFICE A BRUISING OF THE BRAIN THAT DR. GOLDEN HAD MISSED. THEY POINTED OUT SOME FINDINGS THAT THEIR CORONER'S OFFICE HAD ACTUALLY MISSED, AND THEY ADVISED THEM AND LET THEM KNOW.THERE WAS A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT FILED REGARDING THAT ALSO.DR. BADIN, AS THE EXPERT, WILL TESTIFY THAT THE L.A. COUNTY CORONER'S OFFICE VIOLATED THEIR OWN PROCEDURES IN PERFORMING THESE TWO AUTOPSIES. HE WILL INDICATE FURTHER THAT THE AUTOPSY FINDINGS IN THIS CASE ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE STRUGGLE THAT RESULTED IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT, THAT MR. GOLDMAN DID IN FACT BLEED PROFUSELY AND HE BLED SLOWLY AND THAT HE WAS STANDING THROUGH MOST OF THIS; AND THAT IN HIS OPINION, THE PERPETRATOR WOULD BE COVERED WITH MR. GOLDMAN'S BLOOD.HE ALSO -- DR. BADIN WILL TESTIFY THAT THERE ARE BLOOD DROPS ON THE BACK OF MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON AND THERE WERE NO SWABS TAKEN. IN FACT, WHEN THE BODY WAS MOVED AND TAKEN TO THE LAB, THOSE BLOOD DROPS, WHICH VERY WELL MAY HAVE BEEN OF THE PERPETRATOR, WERE WIPED OFF OR WASHED OFF, NEVER PRESERVED.AND SO WHAT I EXPECT THE EVIDENCE TO SHOW THROUGH OUR TESTIMONY AND THROUGH CROSS-EXAMINATION AS I'VE INDICATED, THAT CORONER'S INVESTIGATORS WHO CAME TO THAT SCENE ALSO DIDN'T WEAR ANY COVERING OVER THEIR SHOES, THAT WE EXPECT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THIS SCENE WAS TRACKED THROUGH AND TRAIPSED THROUGH BY THE CORONER'S PEOPLE JUST AS IT HAD BEEN BY THE LAPD PEOPLE. AND AT SOME TIME IN THIS TRIAL, WE HOPE TO HAVE SOME GRAPHIC VIDEO EVIDENCE OF THAT FACT TOO SO YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF.IN SHORT, FROM OUR STANDPOINT, FROM THE DEFENSE STANDPOINT IN WANTING A FAIR TRIAL, BEING ABLE TO DEFEND OUR CLIENT, THE ACTIONS OF THE CORONER'S OFFICE HAS OBVIOUSLY MADE EVERYONE'S JOB AND SPECIFICALLY THE DEFENSE'S JOB MUCH MORE DIFFICULT; THAT WHEN THE LAPD FAILED TO NOTIFY THE CORONER'S OFFICE FOR 10 HOURS, VIOLATING THE STATE LAW, IT MADE EVERYBODY'S JOB MORE DIFFICULT.DR. GOLDEN, WHEN HE TESTIFIES AND AS HE TESTIFIED AT THE PRELIMINARY HEARING, WAS ASKED QUESTIONS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THERE COULD HAVE BEEN TWO KNIVES USED IN THESE TWO KILLINGS, WILL INDICATE THAT SOME OF THE WOUNDS ON THESE TWO VICTIMS ARE CONSISTENT WITH A DOUBLE-EDGE KNIFE, SOME ARE CONSISTENT WITH A SINGLE-EDGE KNIFE OR BLADE. SO IT WOULD BE CONSISTENT THAT PERHAPS TWO KNIVES WERE USED, AND I THINK THAT WE CAN EXPECT THAT FROM HIS TESTIMONY EITHER BY THE PEOPLE OR BY US IF HE IS CALLED TO SO TESTIFY.IN ADDITION TO DR. MICHAEL BADIN, WE WILL HAVE FOR YOU TO TESTIFY DR. HENRY LEE, THE FOREMOST FORENSIC CRIME SCENE ANALYST IN AMERICA. HE IS HEAD OF THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT LAB. HE WILL BE HERE TO SHARE WITH YOU HIS FINDINGS WITH REGARD TO THIS CRIME SCENE AND WHAT TOOK PLACE AT THAT CRIME SCENE AND THE CONTAMINATION OF THE EVIDENCE THEREOF.NOW, WITH REGARD TO THE OPENING STATEMENT YESTERDAY, AS I SAID, YOU WERE TOLD THAT IN THIS CASE, THE CORONER'S OFFICE COULDN'T DO ANY BETTER THAN THREE HOURS. AND I THINK THE EVIDENCE WE ARE GOING TO SHOW YOU SHOWS THEY COULD HAVE DONE AN AWFUL LOT BETTER, AND WE'LL HAVE OTHER CASES TO CITE FOR THAT.I'VE COVERED WITH YOU THIS MORNING THE QUESTION OF THE TIME LINE. WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT AT THE VERY END AGAIN.MISS CLARK TALKS ABOUT A TRAIL OF BLOOD WHERE THERE IS NO TRAIL, AND WE WILL EXPECT TO HAVE EVIDENCE SHOWING THAT, WHEREAS SHE TOLD YOU YESTERDAY TIME AND TIME AGAIN THAT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR MATCHES TO EXCLUDE, TO EXCLUDE, TO EXCLUDE, THAT WHAT SHE DID NOT TELL YOU IS THAT THERE ARE TRAILS THAT LEAD TOWARD INNOCENCE AND THEY WERE NOT PURSUED.LET ME GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES BASED UPON THE EVIDENCE THAT I EXPECT TO PRODUCE IN THIS TRIAL.THERE IT IS. AND I'LL GO THROUGH THIS LIST FOR YOU.I EXPECT THE EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT THERE WAS BLOOD UNDER MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S FINGERNAILS THAT CAME BACK A TYPE B, EAP GENETIC MARKER, AND THAT DOES NOT MEET THE GENETIC PROFILE OF MR. SIMPSON, MR. GOLDMAN OR MISS BROWN; SOME OTHER PERSON. THAT THERE WAS BLOOD FOUND ON MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S THIGH, AND THAT CAME BACK ALSO TO TYPE B.THERE WAS, AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE IN THIS CASE, ALL KINDS OF EVIDENCE COMING FORWARD, PEOPLE THAT WANT TO VOLUNTEER THINGS. THERE WAS A KNIFE FOUND SHORTLY AFTER THESE KILLINGS, AND THE BLOOD ON ONE OF THE KNIVES FOUND ALSO WAS THIS TYPE B, SIMILAR TO THE BLOOD THAT WAS FOUND UNDER MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S FINGERNAILS. YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT BLOOD TO BE OF THE PERPETRATOR SINCE IT'S NOT HERS.WE WILL IN A SHORT TIME SHOW YOU A GRAPHIC OF SEVERAL THINGS IN THAT CONNECTION.THERE WERE IDENTIFIABLE FINGERPRINTS WHICH NOT MATCH AND DON'T MATCH MR. O.J. SIMPSON OR ANY OF THE POLICE OFFICERS THERE. AND THIS BECOMES RELEVANT WE THINK BECAUSE THE CONTENTION OF THE PROSECUTION IS, ONE OF THE GLOVES WAS LOST IN THIS STRUGGLE SUPPOSEDLY.THERE'S IDENTIFIABLE PALM PRINTS. THERE'S NO MATCH TO MR. O.J. SIMPSON.OUR EXPERTS WILL TESTIFY THERE ARE DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF SHOE IMPRINTS AT THIS SCENE INDICATING PERHAPS MORE THAN ONE PERSON. NO MENTION OF THAT THUS FAR. WE EXPECT THAT TO BE THE TESTIMONY.THERE ARE NO HAIRS ON THE BUNDY GLOVE THAT ARE MATCHED TO MR. O.J. SIMPSON. THERE ARE NEGROID HAIRS ON THE KNIT CAP AT BUNDY THAT DO NOT MATCH MR. O.J. SIMPSON.THE PROSECUTION HAS NEVER TO THIS DATE DONE ANY DNA TESTS AS WE KNOW -- AS FAR AS WE KNOW RATHER ON THE BUNDY GLOVE. TESTING HAS BEEN SLOW.THAT WHEN THE INVESTIGATORS ARRIVED AT THE SCENE OF THESE DOUBLE MURDERS -- SHE TALKED TO YOU ABOUT SOMEBODY NAMED DETECTIVE RISKE.WELL, RISKE MAY HAVE BEEN THE OFFICER WHO CAME THERE, BUT THIS CASE WAS ASSIGNED TO PHILLIPS AND FUHRMAN. THIS WAS THEIR CASE. THIS IS WEST LOS ANGELES HOMICIDE, PHILLIPS AND FUHRMAN, THAT IT WAS TRANSFERRED FROM THEM BECAUSE OF THE HIGH-PROFILE NATURE OF THE CASE TO ROBBERY/HOMICIDE THEREAFTER.PHILLIPS AND FUHRMAN CONTINUED TO PLAY AN ACTIVE ROLE IN THIS CASE. YOU WILL HEAR VERY, VERY LITTLE ABOUT AN OFFICER RISKE.BUT ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS THAT I THINK YOU'LL FIND ABOUT THIS CRIME SCENE IS THE DEARTH OR LACK OF ANY PHOTOGRAPHS, EXAMINATION OR INVESTIGATION INSIDE THAT HOUSE. I DON'T THINK YOU WILL FIND ONE PHOTOGRAPH FROM INSIDE THAT HOUSE.THERE WILL BE SOME EVIDENCE THAT THE OFFICERS WHO ARRIVED AT THAT SCENE SHORTLY AFTER FINDING THESE BODIES FOUND A PARTIALLY MELTING CUP OF ICE CREAM FROM BEN AND JERRY'S. WE DON'T HAVE THAT. I DON'T KNOW -- THERE WERE NO PICTURES TAKEN OF IT. SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY WAY OF SEEING HOW MUCH WAS MENTIONED. WE'RE PRECLUDED FROM THAT AT THIS POINT. THIS WAS FOUND NEAR THE BACK OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BUNDY HOME.YOU HEARD A LOT YESTERDAY ABOUT BLOOD DROPS AT BUNDY. YOU COULD TELL THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS DROPS OF BLOOD AT THAT SCENE. MISS CLARK TALKED TO YOU ABOUT FIVE BLOOD DROPS.WHAT WE EXPECT THE EVIDENCE TO SHOW, THE BLOOD DROPS THAT THEY FOUND HAD VERY, VERY LITTLE DNA.IN THE GRAPHICS SOON, I WILL TRY TO DEMONSTRATE FOR YOU THE AMOUNT OF THE DNA FOUND IN THESE BLOOD DROPS, WHICH MEANT THAT THESE BLOOD DROPS, ACCORDING TO OUR EXPERTS, WERE EITHER OLD OR DEGRADED, CONTAMINATED BY PEOPLE WHO COLLECTED THEM AND TESTED THEM.AND OF COURSE, THE BLOOD DROPS AT BUNDY ARE IN AN AREA WHERE MR. SIMPSON AND HIS CHILDREN HAVE OBVIOUSLY BEEN ON MANY OCCASIONS.THERE WERE TIRE TRACKS IN THE BACK OF THE HOUSE WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MATCHED TO ANY OF MR. O.J. SIMPSON'S VEHICLES.NOW, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE EXPECT TO SHOW DURING THE COURSE OF THIS -- OUR PRESENTATION OF EVIDENCE IS THAT THERE WAS IN FACT A MAJOR STRUGGLE AND MR. GOLDMAN FOUGHT VALIANTLY.HE WAS APPARENTLY PHYSICALLY FIT, 5/10 AND 170 PLUS. HE WAS STABBED A NUMBER OF TIMES, PERHAPS 30, AND THERE WAS BLOOD ON HIS HANDS AND ARMS. HE HAD A NUMBER OF DEFENSIVE WOUNDS.AND THE EXPERTS WILL TESTIFY THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT THE PERPETRATOR'S -- THAT MR. GOLDMAN'S BLOOD WOULD BE ALL OVER THE PERPETRATOR'S CLOTHES, HAIR, ALL OVER HIS BODY. IN FACT, HE WOULD BE SATURATED WITH MR. GOLDMAN'S BLOOD.AND OF COURSE, UNDER THE PROSECUTION'S THEORY, THE PERPETRATOR WAS DRIVING THAT BRONCO THAT NIGHT. THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF GOLDMAN'S OR NICOLE SIMPSON'S BLOODSTAINS INSIDE THAT BRONCO OF THE AMOUNT THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT GIVEN THIS SITUATION; THAT THE PATTERN OF BLOOD THAT THEY TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY, SMALL, SMALL, VERY SMALL PATTERN OF BLOOD IN THAT VEHICLE IS VERY CONSISTENT WITH WHAT I EXPECT YOU WILL HEAR IN A STATEMENT MADE BY MR. SIMPSON.NOW, MISS CLARK WENT ON YESTERDAY AND SAID THAT WITH REGARD TO THE DNA EVIDENCE -- SHE TALKED A LITTLE ABOUT DNA. SHE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT OR MAKE A DISTINCTION FOR YOU BETWEEN THE RFLP, THE RESTRICTION FRAGMENT LENGTH POLYMORPHISM OR POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION, PCR, WHICH OUR EXPERT BASICALLY INVENTED IT.BUT I THINK WHAT YOU'LL FIND IS, THIS IS VERY, VERY SENSITIVE EVIDENCE THAT IS THEN XEROXED UP, MELITURICALLY XEROXED. AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE MORE LATER.WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THE PATTERN --BEFORE I TELL YOU THAT, I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL ALSO SHOW THAT ON THE STEERING COLUMN OF THE BRONCO, ITEM NUMBER 29 OF PEOPLE'S EXHIBITS -- I DON'T THINK YOU WERE TOLD THIS YESTERDAY -- THAT THEY DID NOT TALK ABOUT A DNA MIXTURE CONSISTENT WITH, CONSISTENT WITH, NOT NECESSARILY A MATCH, CONSISTENT WITH MR. SIMPSON AND SOMEONE OTHER THAN NICOLE OR RONALD GOLDMAN, SOME OTHER PERSON.WITH REGARD TO ROCKINGHAM, MR. SIMPSON'S RESIDENCE, AGAIN, I EXPECT THERE WILL BE TESTIMONY THAT MR. SIMPSON DID IN FACT CUT HIS FINGER AT SOME PLACE WHERE I'M POINTING NOW, NEAR THE END OF HIS MIDDLE FINGER, AND HE SO TOLD THE POLICE THAT EVENING, JANUARY 13, AND THAT HE WENT OUT -- HE DID IT EITHER AS HE WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE OR WHEN HE WENT OUT TO THE BRONCO TO GET HIS CELLULAR PHONE.THAT WHAT I THINK YOU'LL FIND AND WHAT I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW IS THAT THE REASON THERE WAS NO BLOOD COMING UP THE STAIRS -- AND THIS CARPET IN THIS HOUSE, I THINK YOU'LL FIND THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW, IS LARGELY WHITE, LARGELY VERY LIGHT. IF YOU HAVE A JURY VIEW, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE FOR YOURSELF.THEY DIDN'T FIND ANY BLOOD OTHER THAN WHAT YOU SAW OUTSIDE AND JUST IN THAT ENTRYWAY. I THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT LEADS TOWARDS THE KITCHEN. AND UNDOUBTEDLY, THERE WILL BE TESTIMONY WITH REGARD TO THAT INJURY, IF ANY, OCCURRING BEFORE HE EVER LEFT FOR CHICAGO.THERE WILL BE, AS I UNDERSTAND THE EVIDENCE, NO TRACE OF BLOOD ON THE WHITE CARPET UPSTAIRS OR ON THE STAIRS OR UPSTAIRS, NO TRACE OF BLOOD ON THE WHITE CARPET OF ANY BLOODY SHOES, NO TRACE OF BLOOD ON THE WHITE CARPET OF ANY BLOODY PANTS OR SHIRTS AND NO TRACE OF BLOOD ON THIS WHITE CARPET FROM ANY BLOODY SOCKS.THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THE -- IN AN EFFORT TO FIND ANY EVIDENCE NOT TO EXCLUDE, BUT TO INCLUDE MR. SIMPSON, THEY SEARCHED EVERYWHERE IN THE AREA IN LOS ANGELES. THEY SEARCHED IN CHICAGO. THEY SEARCHED EVERYWHERE THEY POSSIBLY COULD THINK, AND THEY DID NOT FIND ANY WEAPON OR ANY CLOTHES BECAUSE MR. SIMPSON, THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW, DID NOT HAVE IT.THEY TOOK APART TRAPS AND PIPES FROM HIS SINK, SHOWERS AND PLUMBING AND SEARCHED EVERYWHERE FOR THESE VARIOUS THINGS.THE EVIDENCE WILL ALSO SHOW THAT WITH REGARD TO MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON --

#MR. COCHRAN: ,"THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.WITH REGARD TO MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, WHICH I WAS ABOUT TO TALK ABOUT, THE TESTIMONY -- WE BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE WILL BE THAT BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF HER INJURIES, A LOT OF BLOOD CAME FORTH, SO THAT THE PERPETRATOR WOULD IN ALL LIKELIHOOD BE COVERED AND SOAKED AGAIN WITH HER BLOOD.WE THINK THIS WILL BECOME IMPORTANT AGAIN WHEN YOU DETERMINE THE ABSENCE OR LACK OF BLOOD CERTAINLY WITH REGARD TO MR. SIMPSON, NOT PERHAPS REGARDING THE PERPETRATORS OF THIS OFFENSE.MISS CLARK YESTERDAY TALKED ABOUT A MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARING BLACK BAG. WE EXPECT THERE WILL BE VIDEOS IN THIS CASE THAT THE BLACK BAG I PRESUME SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT WAS WHAT MR. SIMPSON BROUGHT BACK WITH HIM FROM CHICAGO. HE CAN BE SEEN CLEARLY IN THAT VIDEO WITH THAT BLACK BAG. AND I BELIEVE IT WAS IN POLICE CUSTODY. CERTAINLY AT ONE POINT, I KNOW THEY HAD IT IN THEIR CUSTODY.SO IT DIDN'T SEEM TO US A BIG MYSTERY. BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE AS IT DEVELOPS. BUT WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY MISSING BLACK BAG THAT MR. SIMPSON HAS OR WHATEVER.SO LOOKING AT THE EVIDENCE AT ROCKINGHAM THEN, THERE'S THIS ROCKINGHAM GLOVE THAT IS SUPPOSEDLY FOUND IN AN AREA THAT YOU SAW SOME PICTURES ABOUT YESTERDAY. MR. SIMPSON'S HOME HAS A VERY, VERY NARROW PATHWAY ON THE SIDE OF HIS HOUSE. YOU SAW THE PICTURES OF THESE -- OF THIS GLOVE. IT WAS ON TOP OF SOME LEAVES.THERE WILL BE NO TESTIMONY AS I UNDERSTAND IT ABOUT ANY BLOOD DROPS LEADING TO AND FROM THAT.THEN, AS I EXPECT THE EVIDENCE TO SHOW, THERE'S A FENCE RIGHT UP THERE CLOSE BY THIS BLOOD DROP. THIS PATHWAY LEADS BASICALLY TO A BACKYARD AREA THAT'S KIND OF BASICALLY ENCLOSED. I THINK THERE'S MAYBE A GATE ON ONE SIDE.I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW IF SOMEBODY WANTED TO COME IN THE HOUSE ON THAT SIDE -- AND YOU'LL SEE THIS WHEN YOU GO OUT THERE -- THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO DOORS ON THAT SIDE THAT SOMEBODY COULD GO RIGHT INSIDE THE HOUSE WITHOUT CLIMBING OVER A FENCE OR ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE.YOU WILL SEE THE EVIDENCE. AND AGAIN, YOU WILL BE THE ONE WHO CAN HELP MAKE THOSE FACTS.BUT WITH REGARD TO THIS GLOVE WHICH WAS -- AND THEN AGAIN, I THINK -- LET ME TRY TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT FOR YOU.THIS GLOVE WAS NOT FOUND BY THEM OR THE OFFICERS OR WHATEVER. THIS GLOVE WAS FOUND BY DETECTIVE FUHRMAN. HE FOUND IT, HE THEN INDIVIDUALLY TOOK THESE OTHER OFFICERS BACK THERE SUPPOSEDLY TO SEE IT. THEY SUPPOSEDLY BROUGHT A PHOTOGRAPHER OVER THERE TO TAKE PICTURES OF IT. ALTHOUGH YOU DIDN'T HEAR THAT YESTERDAY, THOSE ARE THE FACTS AS I UNDERSTAND THEM.AS I SAID, THERE'S NO BLOOD TRAIL TO THESE LEAVES. THE LEAVES DON'T APPEAR TO BE DISTURBED. THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF ANY HAIRS, FIBERS ON THIS FENCE.AND THERE WAS TESTIMONY -- WILL BE TESTIMONY I BELIEVE THAT THERE WERE COBWEBS IN THIS AREA BEYOND THIS GLOVE. PRESUMABLY, ONE COULD INFER NOBODY HAD BEEN BACK THERE FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME TO KNOCK THOSE COBWEBS DOWN.WITH REGARD TO THIS GLOVE, THERE'S ALSO ON THIS GLOVE A CAUCASIAN HAIR ON THIS GLOVE THAT DOES NOT MATCH THE HAIR OF EITHER NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON OR RON GOLDMAN.AND MISS CLARK TOLD YOU YESTERDAY THAT HAIR SAMPLES ARE COLLECTED. AND WHO COLLECTS THEM ARE IMPORTANT. I ALLUDED TO THIS BRIEFLY, BUT WE THINK THAT THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THE NOBLE PEACE PRIZE WINNER WHO INVENTED THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL TELL YOU IT IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE HOW THIS IS COLLECTED BECAUSE OF THE SENSITIVE NATURE, HOW VERY SMALL. YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE SOME OF THESE SAMPLES.YOU'LL HEAR THAT TESTIMONY FROM DR. CARY MULLIS. YOU WILL ALSO HEAR TESTIMONY FROM DR. JOHN GURTIS, ANOTHER LEADING EXPERT FROM DENVER WHO WE EXPECT WILL COME AND TESTIFY.IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ANY ATTEMPT TO -- IN THE EVIDENCE TO MAKE IT SEEM AS THOUGH PCR TECHNOLOGY AND DNA AND RFLP IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND. IT'S VERY COMPLEX. I THINK FROM BOTH SIDES, WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE THIS AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE.I THINK THAT YOU WILL HEAR TESTIMONY -- AND I ASK YOU OF COURSE TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND UNTIL YOU HEAR THE EXPERTS ON BOTH SIDES, AND I THINK YOU'LL GET A CLEAR PICTURE OF THIS PARTICULAR EVIDENCE.I MENTIONED BEFORE THIS CRIME SCENE AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WERE ALLOWED TO WALK THROUGH THERE, MANY WITH JUST THEIR SHOES ON WALKING RIGHT THROUGH THE BLOOD. SOME HAD THOSE LITTLE BOOTIES ON. SOME HAD GLOVES, SOME DIDN'T HAVE GLOVES.PICKING UP THE EVIDENCE, THIS WILL BECOME VERY RELEVANT, IMPORTANT TO YOU AS YOU HEAR FROM THE EXPERTS ABOUT THE CONTAMINATION ASPECT OF THIS AND WHAT IT MEANS AND HOW EASY IT IS, A SNEEZE, A TOUCH, WHATEVER FOR THIS EVIDENCE TO BECOME CONTAMINATED.YOU WILL HEAR ABOUT THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY. YOU WILL HEAR ALSO THAT THE EXPERT WHO INVENTED IT DOESN'T BELIEVE IT'S BEING PROPERLY AND APPROPRIATELY APPLIED AND IT'S NOT READY PERHAPS IN A FORENSIC SENSE TO BE USED; THAT IS TO BE USED AT A CRIME SCENE AND THEN BROUGHT TO COURT.MISS CLARK TALKED TO YOU YESTERDAY ABOUT THE MEDICAL USES OF IT. SHE TALKED ABOUT AMNIOCENTESIS. THAT WAS NICE. BUT IN AN AMNIOCENTESIS, YOU HAVE KNOWN INDIVIDUALS. YOU KNOW WHO THE FATHER AND THE MOTHER ARE, AT LEAST YOU'D BETTER KNOW WHO THEY ARE.WHEN YOU TAKE THE FLUID, YOU DO THAT IN A LAB, A CLEAN SETTING, NOT LIKE A CRIME SCENE OR WHATEVER. YOU WILL HEAR THE DISTINCTION, AS I SAID BEFORE, THIS 21ST CENTURY CYBERSPACE TECHNOLOGY USED BY PEOPLE POORLY TRAINED IN THE FIELD USING LIKE 19TH CENTURY TECHNIQUES TO COLLECT IT.MISS CLARK MENTIONED TO US YESTERDAY ABOUT JURASSIC PARK. THIS IS NOT A MOVIE. YOU CAN'T -- IT WOULD BE FANTASY TO THINK THAT YOU COULD TAKE AND MAKE DINOSAURS FROM DNA. NOBODY HAS DONE THAT. THAT'S A MOVIE, IT'S NOT REAL LIFE.SHE TALKED TO US ABOUT CZARS IN RUSSIA AND THAT SORT OF THING. IT'S ONE THING TO LOOK FOR BONES. THERE IS TECHNOLOGY THAT YOU HEAR ABOUT THAT WAS NOT USED IN THIS CASE. IT'S A DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY ALL TOGETHER, SOME KIND OF SEQUENTIAL DNA TESTING CALLED MITOCHONDRION. I WON'T BORE YOU WITH THE TERM, BUT THAT'S NOT USED. BUT THE EXPERT WILL TELL YOU IT'S NOT RELEVANT TO THE PROCEEDING HERE, WHAT WAS DONE HERE.SO WITH REGARD TO THE CLAIM THAT EVERY EFFORT WAS MADE TO EXCLUDE MR. SIMPSON, WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS CASE.YOU ARE ASKED TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND. WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT WHEN TEST RESULTS POINTED AWAY FROM MR. SIMPSON, THEY CONCLUDED SOMETHING MUST BE WRONG WITH THE TEST.OUR EXPERTS WILL TELL YOU THAT THERE ARE HUGE INTERPRETATION PROBLEMS WITH MANY OF THE TESTS PERFORMED IN THIS CASE. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE WHERE THERE ARE MIXED SAMPLES CONTAINING BLOOD OR OTHER BIOLOGICAL MATERIAL FROM MORE THAN ONE PERSON.WE EXPECT TO SHOW THAT THE RESULTS OF SOME OF THE TESTS IN THIS CASE ARE SO AMBIGUOUS THAT TWO DIFFERENT SCIENTISTS WILL COME TO TWO DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS, BUT THE SAME RESULTS.AS I SAID EARLIER, GIVEN MR. SIMPSON'S STATEMENT TO THE POLICE, THE EVIDENCE OF ANY BLOOD IN THE BRONCO IS FAR MORE CONSISTENT WE BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW WITH MR. SIMPSON'S INNOCENCE THAN ANY GUILT, AND THE FACT THAT THERE'S ALMOST NO BLOOD OF ANYONE ELSE, IF ANY, IN THAT BRONCO IS JUST THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT IF SOMEBODY COMMITTED A CRIME AND USED THAT VEHICLE AS A MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION.NOW, TO CONCLUDE THEN WITH REGARD TO MY DISCUSSION OF MISS CLARK'S OPENING STATEMENT, A NUMBER OF THINGS WERE SAID TO YOU YESTERDAY. AND JUDGE ITO AT THE END OF THE DAY ASKED YOU TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND.AS I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS CASE LAST NIGHT, I WAS CONCERNED JUST FOR A MOMENT, BECAUSE I THOUGHT ABOUT, WE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO TALK TO THEM YET THROUGH CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND OUR CONTROL. BUT WHAT QUICKLY CAME TO MY MIND WAS THE FACT THAT THE JURY THAT WE'VE TRIED TO WORK AND PICK SINCE SEPTEMBER THAT'S BEEN SO PATIENT WOULD KEEP AN OPEN MIND.AND I AM SURE YOU WILL DO THAT, AND THAT'S ALL WE ARE ASKING. NOT ONLY FROM LAST NIGHT TO TODAY, BUT UNTIL YOU HEAR THE END OF THE CASE, BECAUSE YOU REMEMBER WHAT WE SAID AND PART OF WHAT I'M SAYING TO YOU TODAY IS THAT THE CASE WON'T BE OVER UNTIL YOU'VE HEARD ALL THE EVIDENCE AND SUMMATIONS BY THE LAWYERS. AND ALL OF YOU HAVE SAID THAT WOULD BE UNFAIR TO MAKE UP YOUR MIND BEFORE THAT, AND I THINK BOTH SIDES WOULD AGREE WITH THAT.IN HER CONCLUSION YESTERDAY, SHE INDICATED THAT -- SOMETHING ABOUT IT WAS DEVASTATING, PROOF OF SOMETHING OR OTHER IF YOU REMEMBER. IT SEEMS TO ME, AS I THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT SHE SAID, THE FACT THERE IS NO BLOOD WHERE THERE SHOULD BE BLOOD IS DEVASTATING EVIDENCE OF INNOCENCE.AND WE'LL BE TALKING MORE ABOUT THIS; THAT THE FACT OF BLOOD VOLUNTARILY GIVEN BY A DEFENDANT, MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARS WHEN IT SHOULD BE THERE IS DEVASTATING EVIDENCE THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG.AND FINALLY, IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE FACT THAT BLOOD MYSTERIOUSLY APPEARS ON VITAL PIECES OF EVIDENCE AND IT IS PREDICTED WHAT THE RESULTS WILL BE REGARDING DNA WHEN THAT EVIDENCE IS STILL IN THE POLICE LAB IS DEVASTATING EVIDENCE OF SOMETHING FAR MORE SINISTER.NOW, LET'S TURN OUR ATTENTION AGAIN, IF WE COULD, TO THE LASER DISK SHOWINGS. LET ME START THIS PART OF THE PRESENTATION QUICKLY BY SHOWING YOU AGAIN SOME TRAILS THAT LEAD TO INNOCENCE THAT WEREN'T PURSUED BY THE PROSECUTION TEAM.AND, YOUR HONOR, I WILL BE MOVING AHEAD. CALL OUT THE NUMBER IF YOU CAN.BEFORE WE DO THAT, MR. DOUGLAS, CAN YOU RETRIEVE THE ENVELOPE?MAY WE JUST HAVE A SECOND, YOUR HONOR?BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICTATTORNEY AND DEFENSE COUNSEL.)

HARRIS.TO CONCLUDE THEN MISS CLARK'S OPENING STATEMENT.I WOULD LIKE NOW TO MOVE TO A DISCUSSION OF WHAT I EXPECT THE EVIDENCE TO SHOW, VIS-A-VIS, THE DEFENSE IN THIS MATTER.YOU MAY HAVE ASKED YOURSELF, HEARING THIS EVIDENCE THUS FAR, WHO THEN IS O.J. SIMPSON. THAT'S AN ANSWER THAT WILL COME HOPEFULLY DURING THE COURSE OF THIS TRIAL.I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT HE IS A 47-YEAR OLD MAN, FATHER OF FOUR. IN MANY RESPECTS, HE'S THE LIVING EMBODIMENT OF THE AMERICAN DREAM.I THINK YOU WILL HEAR TESTIMONY IN EVIDENCE ABOUT CERTAIN OTHER THINGS YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT O.J. SIMPSON THAT MAY BECOME RELEVANT DURING THESE PROCEEDINGS.THERE WILL BE TESTIMONY THAT O.J. SIMPSON SUFFERS WITH CHRONIC RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS FROM ONE OF THE LEADING RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS DOCTORS IN THE COUNTRY, AND THAT WHEN HE'S IN REMISSION, HE CAN FUNCTION FAIRLY WELL. BUT WHEN HE'S IN THE ACUTE PHASE, HE HAS GREAT TROUBLE FUNCTIONING.WE EXPECT THERE WILL BE TESTIMONY THAT ON THE DATE OF JUNE 12TH, MR. SIMPSON WAS INVOLVED IN THE ACUTE PHASE OF HIS RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS; AND ON THAT DATE, AFTER HE HAD PLAYED GOLF, THE PROBLEMS WITH HIS HANDS WAS SO SEVERE, HE COULD NOT SHUFFLE THE CARDS WHEN HE PLAYED GIN RUMMY AT THE COUNTRY CLUB THAT AFTERNOON. WE EXPECT THAT IS THE EVIDENCE THAT WILL BE ADDUCED.YOU WILL HEAR FROM SEVERAL OF HIS DOCTORS WHO ARE ON OUR WITNESS LIST WHO WILL FURTHER BUTTRESS THE FACT HE WAS IN AN ACUTE PHASE OF THIS RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS SHORTLY AFTER HE CAME INTO CUSTODY.MR. SIMPSON HAD SURGERY IN WHICH SOME LYMPH NODES WERE REMOVED. THESE LYMPH NODES WERE CAUSED BY THE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, WHICH CONTAINED WHITE BLOOD CELLS.IN ADDITION TO THAT, I ALLUDED TO THE FACT EARLIER THAT HE WAS PERHAPS THE GREATEST RUNNING BACK IN THE HISTORY OF THE NFL WITH ALL KINDS OF RECORDS. BUT YOU PAY A PRICE. AND IN THE EVIDENCE, WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT PRICE THAT HE PAID.ON HIS LEFT KNEE, HE'S HAD FOUR SURGERIES. WE EXPECT YOU WILL HEAR FROM HIS DOCTOR ABOUT THE EFFECT OF THOSE FOUR SURGERIES, ABOUT THE EFFECT OF WHAT HE HAS IN ADDITION TO THE CHRONIC OR ACUTE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, HE HAS OSTEOARTHRITIS IN HIS LEGS.THE EVIDENCE WILL BE, HE SUFFERS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS IN BOTH OF HIS WRISTS.AND SO THINGS ARE NOT AS THEY ALWAYS SEEM. AND AS YOU SEE HIM SITTING THERE NOW, HE DOES IN FACT HAVE PROBLEMS WITH MOVEMENT.THERE WILL BE TESTIMONY THAT HE PLAYS GOLF, THAT HE CAN NO LONGER PLAY TENNIS, THAT WHEN HE PLAYS GOLF, HE ALWAYS HAS TO USE A GOLF CART. HE CAN'T WALK 18 HOLES.I EXPECT THERE WILL BE TESTIMONY THAT HE'S PERHAPS ONE OF THE ONLY FEW PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WHO IS ABLE TO USE A GOLF CART AT PEBBLE BEACH BECAUSE HIS DOCTOR HAD TO WRITE SUCH A LETTER.AND SO I WOULD LIKE -- I WOULD LIKE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT FOR YOU, THE EXTENT OF HIS KNEES AND SAY TO YOU THAT WHAT NO NFL NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE PLAYER WANTS TO HEAR, THAT MOTHER NATURE AND FATHER TIME HAS TAKEN ITS TOLL. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY CAN'T MOVE AROUND, BUT I THINK THERE WILL BE EVIDENCE OF LIMITATIONS NOW IMPOSED UPON HIM BY VIRTUE OF HIS CAREER, BY VIRTUE OF THESE INDICES THAT HE SUFFERS.YOUR HONOR, I WOULD LIKE AT THIS POINT TO HAVE MR. SIMPSON COME OVER TO THE JURY SO I CAN DEMONSTRATE THE PROBLEM WITH HIS KNEES.DEPUTY MAGNERA.

SIMPSON. SO HE HAD OCCASION TO WATCH MR. O.J. SIMPSON, WATCH HIS HANDS, AND HE'LL TELL YOU HE DIDN'T SEE ANY MAJOR CUTS ON HIS HANDS OR ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE; THAT HE OBSERVED HIS DEMEANOR, OBSERVED HOW HE ACTED, OBSERVED HOW HE HANDLED HIMSELF DURING THAT PARTICULAR TIME.THAT THERE WAS A MAN ON THIS FLIGHT BY THE NAME OF HOWARD BINGHAM, A MAN FAMOUS IN HIS OWN RIGHT, MOHAMMAD ALI'S PERSONAL PHOTOGRAPHER, LIVES HERE IN LOS ANGELES; THAT HOWARD BINGHAM WAS ON HIS WAY TO SEE MOHAMMAD ALI.HE LEFT HIS SEAT BACK HERE AND WALKED UP AND HAD A CONVERSATION WITH MR. O.J. SIMPSON. HE TOO WILL COME IN AND TELL YOU HOW MR. SIMPSON APPEARED ON JUNE 12TH, 1994 11:45 TO THE TIME THAT FLIGHT GOT THERE IN CHICAGO.AND THERE ARE OTHERS, AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE, WHO HAD SEEN HIM.PARTICULAR INTEREST, THERE'S A CAPTAIN OF THIS FLIGHT, CAPTAIN WAYNE STANSFIELD, WHO FOUND OUT THAT O.J. SIMPSON WAS FLYING TO CHICAGO, AND HE CAME OUT OF THE COCKPIT.YOU KNOW, YOU ALWAYS WORRY WHEN YOU SEE THE PILOT COME OUT. WHEN YOU SEE THE PILOT COMING OUT OF THE COCKPIT, YOU ASSUME THAT MEANS THERE ARE A COUPLE OTHERS FLYING THE PLANE.SO HE CAME OUT AND HE GOT MR. O.J. SIMPSON'S AUTOGRAPH ON THE FLIGHT LOG. SO HE HAD A CHANCE TO SEE HIS HAND, HAD A CHANCE TO OBSERVE HIM.HE SIGNED AUTOGRAPHS AS HE GOT OUT OF THE LIMOUSINE FOR THE SKYCAPS. REMEMBER HE HAD GOTTEN SOME MONEY TO GIVE THE SKYCAPS MONEY. THERE WILL BE TESTIMONY THAT HE HAD $10 OR WHATEVER. THE SKYCAP HAD NO CHANGE, AND HE GAVE HIM THAT OF COURSE.AND YOU WILL HEAR ABOUT THIS FLIGHT. YOU WILL HEAR ABOUT THIS MAN'S DEMEANOR, HEAR ABOUT HOW HE HANDLED HIMSELF, HOW PEOPLE WATCHED HIM DURING THIS PERIOD OF TIME.MR. VALLE ESPECIALLY WAS LOOKING AT HIS HANDS BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THAT O.J. SIMPSON WOULD HAVE A CHAMPIONSHIP RING ON HIS HANDS.

HE WANTED TO COME DIRECTLY BACK TO LOS ANGELES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER THIS CONVERSATION. HE MADE CALLS WHILE ON THE WAY BACK FROM CHICAGO TO LOS ANGELES TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED.WE'LL BE CALLING CERTAINLY MORE THAN ONE WITNESS ON THAT FLIGHT.IT'S VERY INTERESTING, SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO O.J. SIMPSON ON THIS FLIGHT BACK WAS A LAWYER BY THE NAME OF MARK PARTRIDGE. MARK PARTRIDGE SAT WITH HIM THE ENTIRE TIME. HE WILL COME IN HERE -- HE'S A LAWYER IN CHICAGO -- AND TELL YOU ABOUT THIS MAN'S DEMEANOR.ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT THIS I THINK YOU'LL FIND IS, WE'RE AWARE MR. SIMPSON HAD NO CUTS ON HIS HAND, KNUCKLE AREA THAT ANYONE SAW THAT WE KNOW OF GOING. WHEN HE CAME BACK, HE HAD A CUT, WHICH YOU JUST SAW REMNANTS OF, ON HIS KNUCKLE IN THE MIDDLE FINGER.MR. PARTRIDGE SAW THAT. AND THERE WILL BE TESTIMONY THAT IN THE HOTEL ROOM IN CHICAGO, THERE WAS A BROKEN GLASS, SHARDS OF GLASS IN THAT HOTEL ROOM. THERE WAS BLOOD ASSOCIATED WITH THAT GLASS AND WITH THE TOWEL THEREIN.HIS WHOLE DEMEANOR, AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT, HAD CHANGED. HE SUFFERED A TERRIBLE LOST. HE TOOK THE FIRST FLIGHT BACK FROM CHICAGO HERE.WE THINK THAT MARK PARTRIDGE ALONG WITH OTHER PEOPLE WHO MAY BE CALLED ARE VERY, VERY RELEVANT IN THE COURSE OF THIS CASE.NOW, AS DEPRESSED AS HE WAS, PEOPLE WHO CAME IN CONTACT WITH HIM STILL DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT HIS TRAGEDY. PEOPLE WOULD STILL COME UP TO HIM, ASK HIM FOR AUTOGRAPHS DURING THIS PERIOD OF TIME.BUT HE DID GET BACK TO LOS ANGELES SOMETIME THAT DAY, AND HE WENT, WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW, DIRECTLY TO HIS HOME ON ROCKINGHAM WHERE HE WAS, FIRST OF ALL, PLACED IN HANDCUFFS. THEN THEY WERE TAKEN OFF AND THEN HE WAS ASKED IF HE WANTED TO COME DOWNTOWN TO TALK TO THE POLICE -- MAYBE NOT ASKED -- TOLD TO COME DOWN TO TALK TO THE DETECTIVES IN THIS CASE, VANNATTER AND LANGE.HE VOLUNTARILY DID THAT. HE GOT A LAWYER THERE BY THE NAME OF HOWARD WEITZMAN, ONE OF THE MORE PROMINENT LAWYERS HERE IN LOS ANGELES, AND HIS BUSINESS LAWYER SKIP TAFT.WHEN HE CAME HOME, THERE WERE NO POLICE AT THE AIRPORT.

#MR. COCHRAN: ,"GOOD MORNING, YOUR HONOR.YOUR HONOR, FIRST OF ALL, THOSE OF US ON THE DEFENSE ARE VERY SORRY ABOUT MR. HODGMAN'S ILLNESS AND WE WISH HIM A SPEEDY RECOVERY.WE ARE ALSO REPRESENTING MR. O.J. SIMPSON, A MAN WE BELIEVE IS ABSOLUTELY INNOCENT, AND THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT, SO WE HAVE TO KIND OF BALANCE THAT.CERTAINLY, AS I INDICATED TO THE COURT EARLIER, IF THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH MR. HODGMAN BEING HERE AND THAT WILL CAUSE THE PEOPLE SOME PROBLEMS, WE ARE WILLING TO WAIT A COUPLE OF DAYS ON THAT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF PROCEEDING WITH THE EVIDENCE.BUT YOUR HONOR, I NEED HARDLY REMIND THIS COURT, WITH REGARD TO OPENING STATEMENTS, THAT WE WERE READY TO PROCEED WITH OPENING STATEMENTS ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON AFTER THE PEOPLE CONCLUDED AT 3:30 AND BECAUSE OF A GLITCH WHICH WAS NO FAULT -- AN ACCIDENTAL GLITCH, BUT CERTAINLY NO FAULT OF MR. SIMPSON'S, THE COURT TOOK A RECESS AT THAT TIME AND WE WEREN'T ABLE TO FINISH OUR OPENING STATEMENTS.WE ACCEPTED THAT LIKE WE DO ALL THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED HERE.FINALLY YESTERDAY I WAS ABLE TO MAKE MY OPENING STATEMENT. AND I WILL BE VERY INTERESTED IN THEIR MOTION.AS USUAL, THEY TEND TO BE TOTALLY JUDGMENTAL, TALKING ABOUT MISCONDUCT. THERE IS NO MISCONDUCT IN THIS CASE. THEY CAN'T STAND THE TRUTH. I INDICATED THAT BEFORE.IF COUNSEL GETS UP AND IF YOU LOOK VERY CLOSELY AT THAT OPENING STATEMENT I GAVE YESTERDAY AND WE TALKED ABOUT LET'S SAY THE BLOOD UNDER NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S FINGERNAILS, THAT IS NOT ANYTHING THEY TOLD THEM, SO THE FACT THEY ARE UPSET -- THIS IS THE SAME GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR A CONTINUANCE.IF A DEFENDANT HAD DONE THIS, ASKING FOR A CONTINUANCE AND THEN HAVE ALL THESE THINGS AND CONTINUE TO ASK FOR A CONTINUANCE, EVERYONE WOULD BE VERY SUSPICIOUS, BUT HERE IT IS PROSECUTION WHO IS CONTINUALLY DOING THIS SO.ALL I'M ASKING AND WHAT MR. SIMPSON ASKS IS THAT WE BE ALLOWED TO COMPLETE THE OPENING STATEMENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. IT IS UNPRECEDENTED TO HAVE MY OPENING STATEMENT INTERRUPTED ALL OF THESE TIMES, TO HAVE THEM -- TALK ABOUT GETTING UP AND GIVING A FURTHER OPENING STATEMENT. THEN DO I GET TO REBUT THAT?THEY CANNOT SHUT ME UP, YOUR HONOR. I'M GOING TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS CASE. I'M GOING TO COMPLY WITH THE RULE. WE MAKE A MISTAKE, WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT, BUT IF YOU LOOK THROUGH THAT TRANSCRIPT, THE THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT ARE THINGS THAT WE EITHER DISCLOSED TO THEM OR THINGS I KNOW ABOUT THAT I HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO TELL THEM ABOUT.THEY CANNOT GET INSIDE MY HEAD AND THEY MIGHT AS WELL UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU RECALL ONCE BEFORE I SAID THEY ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO SHACKLE ME FROM THE STANDPOINT OF ADDRESSING THE ISSUES.THE COURT HAS ALREADY INDICATED TO THESE JURORS WHAT BOTH COUNSEL SAY IS NOT EVIDENCE AND IF WE DON'T PROVE SOMETHING OR IF WE FALL SHORT OF THAT, THE REMEDY SAYS THE JURORS SAY YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO DO THIS AND YOU DIDN'T DO THAT. YOU HAVE TOLD THEM HOW MANY TIMES THAT IT IS NOT -- OPENING STATEMENT IS NOT EVIDENCE.AND I NOTICE MISS CLARK INADVERTENTLY KEPT USING THE WORDS ""ARGUMENT"" YOU RECALL WHEN THEY WERE GIVING THEIR OPENING STATEMENT, MAKING ALL OF THESE OUTRAGEOUS SPECIOUS CLAIMS ABOUT O.J. SIMPSON, CONTINUING TO TARNISH HIS REPUTATION. WE SAT HERE AND LISTENED TO THAT, AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING FOR SEVEN YEARS -- SEVEN MONTHS.THEY TALK ABOUT ALL THIS MOUND OF EVIDENCE. WE DIDN'T OBJECT. WE TRIED TO CONDUCT OURSELVES AS PROFESSIONALS UNTIL THE VERY END WHEN YOUR HONOR HAD TO ASK MISS CLARK TO SIT DOWN FOR BEING SO ARGUMENTATIVE.THOSE ARE THE FACTS. WE WENT THROUGH THAT YESTERDAY. THEY ASSIGNED MR. HODGMAN TO TRACK MY OPENING STATEMENT WHERE HE OBJECTS THIRTEEN TIMES, ABOUT ELEVEN OF WHICH WERE OVERRULED AND BUT -- AND I TOLD THEM AT THE TIME THEY ARE NOT GOING TO THROW US OFF WITH THAT KIND OF TACTIC, YOUR HONOR.NOW THEY WANT STILL A FURTHER DELAY. SO WE NEED TO PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE AS TO WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE. WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO CONCLUDE OUR OPENING STATEMENT AND GET TO THE CASE.JUDGE, AS SOMEBODY WISE INDICATED, THIS IS THE PEOPLE'S CASE. THEY MADE THIS JUDGMENT BACK ON JUNE 16 TO CALL FOR THIS MAN'S ARREST ON JUNE 17. THEY HAVE THE ENTIRE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT, I PRESUME. THEY HAVE 8000 PERSONS. THEY HAVE THE THIRD OR FOURTH LARGEST POLICE DEPARTMENT IN THIS COUNTY, AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S INVESTIGATORS. THEY HAVE 900 LAWYERS.THEY SAID THEY WERE READY TO GO. THEY HAVE ALL OF THAT ON THEIR SIDE AND YET THEY ARE GOING TO COME WHIMPERING INTO THIS COURT AND CLAIMING THEY DIDN'T KNOW SOMETHING OR THEIR INVESTIGATORS DIDN'T KNOW SOMETHING BECAUSE I HAVE A THEORY IN MY HEAD OR A FACT IN MY HEAD ABOUT THIS MAN'S PHYSICAL CONDITION OR SOMETHING THEY DIDN'T WHAT TO HEAR.SO WE HAVE TO PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE AND THEY WANT TO CALL THAT MISCONDUCT. IT IS NOT MISCONDUCT AT ALL. BOTH OF THEM HAVE BEEN TRYING CASES FOR TWENTY SOME YEARS.I GUESS AS BOB PHILIBOSIAN, WHO WAS A FORMER PROSECUTOR, SAID LAST NIGHT, THIS IS MUCH TO DO ABOUT NOTHING. HE SAID HE TRIED CASES FOR TWENTY YEARS, AS YOU DID, AND NEVER HAD A REPORT FROM THE DEFENSE AND NOW THEY WANT TO GET IN OUR BRIEFCASE. THEY WOULD LIKE TO COME HOME WITH US IF THEY COULD. THEY CAN'T DO THAT. THE LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT.THE FORMER DISTRICT ATTORNEY SAYS THAT AND EVERYBODY SAYS THAT AND WE NEED TO GET DOWN TO IT. THIS IS A STALL, YOUR HONOR. LET ME FINISH MY OPENING STATEMENT. WHY ARE THEY SO AFRAID OF ME ADDRESSING THIS JURY AND TELLING THE TRUTH? THAT IS ABOUT WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT AND THAT IS ALL I WANT TO DO, IS COMPLETE MY OPENING STATEMENT.YOU ARE THE ARBITER AND YOU KNOW YESTERDAY WE WERE TOTALLY RESPECTFUL. EVERY TIME THERE IS AN OBJECTION WE APPROACH THE BENCH. AND WHEN THE COURT GIVES SOME DIRECTIONS, I FOLLOW THOSE DIRECTIONS. I DON'T GO BEYOND THAT. I WAS NOT NEARLY, NEARLY AS ARGUMENTATIVE AS BOTH OF THEM WERE IN THEIR OPENING STATEMENTS, ABSOLUTELY NOT.AND YOUR HONOR -- BECAUSE IF I HAD, YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLING ME ON IT, BUT AT THE END YOU HAD TO HAVE HER SIT DOWN, SO LET'S GET TO WHERE THIS REALLY IS. IT IS NOT ABOUT PERSONALITIES.AND WHAT THIS CASE IS ABOUT IS TRYING TO GET A FAIR TRIAL FOR THIS MAN HERE AND HE SHOULDN'T SUFFER BECAUSE OF THEIR TACTICS AND THEIR STALL TACTICS, AND THAT IS WHAT THIS BOILS DOWN TO.SO WE ARE READY TO PROCEED. AND QUITE FRANKLY I WOULD LIKE TO PROCEED RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE AS YOU'VE ALSO SAID, AND I WANT TO END ON THIS NOTE, THIS ALSO IS ABOUT THESE 22 CITIZEN VOLUNTEERS, AND YESTERDAY WHEN THEY CAME OUT, OR THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY WHEN THEY CAME OUT, YOU SAID ""I HOPE THIS IS THE LAST TIME I WILL HAVE TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU FOR NOT STARTING ON TIME"" AND THEN YOU CAUGHT YOURSELF AND SAID, ""BUT I KNOW IT WON'T BE,"" SO NOW WE GOT TO APOLOGIZE AGAIN TODAY ALL BECAUSE OF THESE DELAYS, AND THE DELAYS ARE FROM THEM.I AM READY TO GO. YOU BASICALLY WOULD BE READY TO GO. THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY READY TO GO. THIS IS THEIR CASE. WHO IS NOT READY TO GO? THE PEOPLE. WHO IS IT WHO WANTS TO LIKE CONTINUE TO CURTAIL WHAT I CAN SAY TO THE JURY? THE PEOPLE.AND IT IS THEIR CASE, JUDGE. AS I SAID THE OTHER DAY, THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR THE TRUTH IN THIS CASE, BUT THE TRUTH WILL COME OUT, AND WHEN YOU PUT IT IN COUNTER POSITION, JUDGE, FOR THE LAST TWO OR THREE WEEKS THEY HAVE BEEN ON A PUBLIC RELATIONS CAMPAIGN TO TAR AND BESMIRCH THIS MAN.

THE REASON FOR THAT IS THIS IS A HIGH SECURITY FLOOR, IT CREATES CONGESTION, IT IS A SECURITY PROBLEM, IT INTERFERES WITH OTHER COURTS, IT INFLUENCES OTHER WITNESSES AND JURORS ON OTHER CASES, AND THERE IS A STANDING ORDER AGAINST THAT.THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT HAS REPORTED TO ME SEVERAL INSTANCES WHERE THE SUPERVISING JUDGE'S ORDERS HAD BEEN VIOLATED. I AM JUST PUTTING COUNSEL ON NOTICE THAT DEPARTMENT 100 WILL BE CONDUCTING CONTEMPT HEARINGS IF THIS OCCURS AGAIN, SO PLEASE FOLLOW THE SUPERVISING JUDGE'S ORDER IN THAT REGARD.WE DO HAVE A FIRST FLOOR PRESS CONFERENCE AREA SET ASIDE FOR THAT PURPOSE.

#THE COURT: ,"CERTAINLY.
","JANUARY 26, 1995 ",10:00 A.M.
#MR. HARMON: ,"THERE ARE ACTUALLY TWO CATEGORIES OF ITEMS THAT HAVE BEEN REQUESTED. THE SECOND CATEGORY INVOLVES PROFICIENCY TESTS AND THOSE COPIES -- BETTER COPIES WILL BE MADE OF THEM.THE FIRST CATEGORY I THINK IS MUCH MORE INTERESTING BECAUSE IT REALLY TIES IN WITH WHAT THE COURT IS STRUGGLING WITH TODAY. AT THE SAME TIME THIS COURT IS CONSIDERING ALLEGATIONS OF SERIOUS INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT BY THE DEFENSE IN DISCOVERY, THE DEFENSE HAS THE TEMERITY TO ASK FOR SOMETHING THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE.I THINK TO ILLUSTRATE THE ABUSIVE EXTENT OF THE DISCOVERY IN THE DNA CONTEXT, I JUST SELECTED ONE OF THE DAYS IN THE LIFE OF GARY SIMS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THE NATURE OF THE REQUEST AND WHY THIS COURT HAS TO DRAW THE LINE AT SOME POINT AT THE SAME TIME THE COURT HAS RECOGNIZED THAT THE LINE HAS BEEN CROSSED BY THE DEFENSE IN OTHER DISCOVERY AREAS.I JUST SELECTED OCTOBER 27 BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO BE THE LONGEST DAY FOR GARY SIMS.HE STARTED WORK AT ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK THAT MORNING. HE DID A FULL DAY'S WORK ON THE DNA TEST RESULTS IN THIS CASE. AND I THINK THE COURT NEEDS TO APPRECIATE, AND THE COURT HAS HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT DNA. WE REALIZE THAT EVERY TEST HAS THE POSSIBILITY OF EXCLUDING SOMEBODY IF THEY DESERVE TO BE EXCLUDED. IF THEY ARE NOT EXCLUDED, THEY WILL BE INCLUDED.SO AT THE SAME TIME THAT MR. SIMS WAS ANALYZING VOLUMES AND VOLUMES OF EVIDENCE ON THIS CASE, TO ACCEPT WHATEVER RESULTS CAME OUT OF IT AND IF MR. SIMPSON WAS GOING TO BE EXCLUDED AND EXONERATED AND SHOWN TO BE INNOCENT, SO BE IT, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE RESULT THAT WAS PRODUCED.AT THE SAME TIME THAT HAPPENED THE COURT HAD PROPERLY INSTITUTED SOME SORT OF RECIPROCAL VISITATION BY DR. BLAKE, AND DR. BLAKE IS THE KEY FIGURE IN THIS DISCOVERY REQUEST, SO GARY SIMS WORKED ALL DAY ANALYZING EVIDENCE ON THIS CASE, AND AS WAS THE NORM -- AND I THINK WHAT HE DID THAT DAY IS ALSO VERY INTERESTING.THAT WAS THE DAY, COINCIDENTALLY, THAT THE SOCK THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF GREAT DISCUSSION WAS EXAMINED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE LAB AND ONE OF THE ITEMS THAT THEY PRODUCED SHOWS THAT THERE IS NO SINISTER ACTIVITY ABOUT THAT SOCK. IT IS AN INFRARED VIDEO THAT SHOWS ONLY ONCE YOU KNOW THERE IS BLOOD ON THE SOCK AND YOU HAVE VISUALLY EXAMINED IT AND YOU HAVE DONE PRESUMPTIVE TESTS, NOT ONLY DOES THAT JUST TELL WHERE YOU SOME OF THE STUFF IS, YOU NEED TO DO INFRARED PHOTOGRAPHY TO SEE OTHER THINGS ONCE YOU REALIZE THAT SOCK HAS BLOOD ALL OVER IT.SO THAT IS WHAT MR. SIMS DID THAT DAY, PREPARED THAT EVIDENCE, PREPARED THE VIDEOTAPE, CAREFULLY DOCUMENTED THINGS AND THE DOCUMENTATION TAKES HOURS AND HOURS.AND THEN WHO SHOWS UP AT 7:45 THAT NIGHT, BUT DR. BLAKE. YOU HAVE TO APPRECIATE THAT DR. BLAKE HAS A BUSINESS AND A LIFE OF HIS OWN, SO HE OFTEN DOESN'T SHOW UP DURING THE DAY, HE SHOWS UP AT NIGHT, WHICH MEANS MR. SIMS HAS TO WORK HIS FULL DAY AND THEN ON INTO THE NIGHT WITH DR. BLAKE.THEY SPENT FIVE HOURS GOING OVER ITEMS, UNPACKAGING ITEMS, DOCUMENTING ITEMS AND TAKING, IN MANY INSTANCES, SIMULTANEOUS PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE VERY SAME THINGS, AND NOW THOSE SIMULTANEOUS PHOTOGRAPHS ARE WHAT IS IN ISSUE AT THIS TEST.THIS IS THE SAME DR. BLAKE THEY HAVE HIDDEN BEHIND THE ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE, AND THIS IS THE SAME DR. BLAKE WHO HAS ALWAYS TESTIFIED IN OPPOSITION TO THE TWO DEFENSE WITNESSES IN THIS CASE, DR. MULLIS AND DR. GERDES.THESE ARE PHOTOGRAPHS THAT WERE TAKEN OF THE SAME ITEMS. THE DEFENSE HAS MADE NO SHOWING, BECAUSE THEY WANT TO HIDE DR. BLAKE. HE HAS NEVER BEEN MENTIONED IN THE OPENING STATEMENT, THAT HIS PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE SAME ITEMS THAT WE'VE GIVEN THEM, WHAT THEY CALL INADEQUATE COPIES, ARE INSUFFICIENT FOR HIS PURPOSES. HE HAS SEEN THEM HIMSELF, HE HAS TAKEN PHOTOGRAPHS OF THEM.IN FACT, I THINK WHAT IS IRONIC ABOUT THE NATURE OF THEIR REQUEST AND THE INVISIBLE DR. BLAKE, WHO HAS BEEN SHIELDED BY THE ATTORNEY/CLIENT PRIVILEGE, IS THAT IN MANY INSTANCES, WHEN DR. BLAKE VIEWED THESE ITEMS, HE INTERPRETED THEM AND CALLED THOSE RESULTS ODDLY -- AND THOSE RESULTS IN EVERY INSTANCE CONCUR WITH THE PROSECUTION EXPERTS RESULTS.SO HERE WE HAVE AN INVISIBLE WITNESS WHO HAS HIS OWN PHOTOS OF THE VERY SAME ITEMS WHO HAS CONCURRED IN MANY INSTANCES VERBALLY WITH THE RESULTS THAT THE PROSECUTION LAB HAS PRODUCED AND THEY JUST SAY WE WANT YOU TO PROVIDE BETTER PHOTOS AND THEY HAVE NEVER DEMONSTRATED THAT THERE IS ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE PHOTOS THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN OF THE VERY SAME ITEMS.COINCIDENTALLY, AS THE COURT IS AWARE, THE DEFENSE HAS NEVER OBTAINED ANY OF THE PHYSICAL BIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE TO DO ANY OF THE TESTING THEMSELVES.DR. BLAKE CAN SHOW UP THERE ANY TIME WITH THE PHOTOS THAT HE HAS TAKEN OF THE ITEMS THAT THEY HAVE REQUESTED WE PROVIDE NEW PHOTOS. HE WAS JUST THERE LAST NIGHT. HE CAN SHOW UP THERE ANY TIME TO SEE THESE THINGS, TO COMPARE HIS PHOTOS WITH THE ORIGINAL PHOTOS AND SEE IF THERE IS ANY DISCREPANCY.I THINK WE'VE COMPLIED WITH IT. THE CONSUMPTION OF TIME THAT IT TAKES DR. -- OR THE DOJ TO ACCOMMODATE DR. BLAKE HAS TAKEN DAYS AND DAYS WORTH OF VALUABLE LABORATORY TIME FROM THIS CASE AND OTHER CASES THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SERVICES WHILE, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THIS CASE GOES ON RAPIDLY TO TRIAL.SO THE DEFENSE SIMPLY HASN'T SHOWN THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING. IN FACT, IT IS CLEAR, IF YOU LOOK AT THESE VOLUMINOUS NOTES, THEY HAVE THEIR OWN COPIES, THEIR OWN ORIGINAL PHOTOS OF THESE VERY SAME ITEMS, SO I THINK IT IS TIME TO DRAW THE LINE.MR. COCHRAN WANTS TO GO TO TRIAL. WE WANT TO GO TO TRIAL, TOO. WE WANT THE WORLD TO SEE THIS.DR. BLAKE HAS SEEN THIS. DR. BLAKE HAS SEEN THESE THINGS BEFORE WE HAVE SEEN THEM, SO I THINK THE COURT SHOULD SAY IT IS TIME.MR. COCHRAN WANTS TO GO TO TRIAL, WE WANT TO GO TO TRIAL AND THERE IS NO BASIS FOR ANY ADDITIONAL BURDENSOME REQUEST.
","JANUARY 26, 1995 ",10:00 A.M.
#MR. BLASIER: ,"YOUR HONOR, THIS IS A DISCOVERY REQUEST FROM OUR SIDE, NOT MR. HARMON'S REQUESTS FOR DR. BLAKE'S MATERIALS.THE PHOTOGRAPHS THAT RESULT FROM THESE TESTS ARE THE BEST EVIDENCE OF THE TEST RESULTS THEMSELVES. THIS IS NOT LIKE WE ARE TAKING A PICTURE OF A PIECE OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, LIKE A PIECE OF CLOTHING THAT WILL THEN BE BROUGHT INTO COURT. THESE PHOTOGRAPHS ARE WHAT THE PROSECUTION WILL BE RELYING ON IN GIVING THEIR INTERPRETATIONS OF THE TEST RESULTS.THERE IS A LOT OF CONTROVERSY IN THE DQ-ALPHA TESTING AREA ABOUT THE INTENSITIES OF DOTS, WHETHER DOTS ARE APPARENT OR NOT. DIFFERENT EXPERTS WILL LOOK AT THE SAME PHOTOS AND GIVE YOU GIVE INTERPRETATIONS OF WHETHER THERE ARE DOTS THERE OR NOT AND IT IS NOT OUT PHOTOGRAPHS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE USING WHERE THEY HAVE THEIR EXPERTS; IT IS THEIR PHOTOS. THAT IS GOING TO BE WHAT THEY WILL BE RELYING ON. THEY ARE NOT BRINGING THE TEST STRIPS IN, BECAUSE THEY FADE VERY QUICKLY, SO BECAUSE THESE ARE SOURCE MATERIALS, WE CERTAINLY ARE ENTITLED. THE EXPERTS ARE GOING TO RELY ON THEM AND WE ARE GOING TO BE CROSS-EXAMINING THEM ABOUT THEIR PICTURES.

#MR. BLASIER: ,"WELL, DR. BLAKE, IT IS TRUE, HAS TAKEN PICTURES OF THE TESTING STRIPS HIMSELF, BUT THAT IS OUR WORK PRODUCT MATERIAL. WE HAVE NOT MADE A DECISION WHETHER DR. BLAKE WILL TESTIFY OR NOT. AT A POINT IN TIME WHERE WE DECIDE THAT HE WILL, WE WILL MAKE AVAILABLE EVERYTHING THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE.BUT IT IS THOSE PHOTOGRAPHS THAT THEY TOOK THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE USING. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE RELYING ON DR. BLAKE'S PHOTOGRAPHS; THEY ARE GOING TO BE RELYING UPON THEIR OWN AND WE ARE GOING TO BE RAISING SIGNIFICANT QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THEY INTERPRET THEIR OWN PHOTOGRAPHS. WE ARE ENTITLED TO THOSE.

#MS. CLARK: ,"MYSELF AND MR. DARDEN WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS YOU ON THESE MATTERS, YOUR HONOR. THEY ARE NUMEROUS, AND THE COURT'S REQUEST IS SOME VERY SPECIFIC STATEMENTS CONCERNING WHAT WE DESIRE WITH RESPECT TO EACH OF THE ITEMS, EACH OF THE WITNESSES AND EACH OF THE STATEMENTS THAT WERE IMPROPERLY MADE BY COUNSEL.EXCUSE ME.I FIND IT -- I MUST SHARE WITH THE COURT THAT I FEEL VERY OUTRAGED AT COUNSEL'S STATEMENTS EARLIER THIS MORNING CONCERNING HIS REPRESENTATIONS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT HIM FROM TELLING THE TRUTH, AND THAT IS SUCH A FALSEHOOD.IF MR. COCHRAN WERE STANDING UP AND TELLING THE JURORS THE TRUTH AND HAD NOT HIDDEN HIS WITNESSES FROM US WILLFULLY IN VIOLATION OF THIS COURT'S ORDER, WE WOULD NOT BE BEFORE THE COURT TODAY AND OPENING STATEMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN CONCLUDED AND THE WITNESS WOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE WITNESS STAND.UNFORTUNATELY, BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THIS MISCONDUCT, WHICH IS EGREGIOUS AND FLAGRANT AND NOT THE MINOR VIOLATION THAT HE ATTEMPTS TO REPRESENT TO THIS COURT, HE'S ATTEMPTING TO SWEEP IT UNDER THE RUG, CLAIM IGNORANCE AND USE MR. DOUGLAS AS A SACRIFICIAL LAMB, AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY INAPPROPRIATE. COUNSEL SHOULD BEAR THE BRUNT OF HIS OWN MISCONDUCT, WHICH IS WILLFUL AND DELIBERATE AND INTENTIONAL AND IT IS IN EFFECT A THUMBING OF HIS NOSE AT THIS COURT'S ORDER.IT IS -- YES, IT'S COUCHED IN NICE SMILES AND INGRATIATING REMARKS, BUT THAT SHOULD NOT DECEIVE THE COURT AND I'M SURE IT DOESN'T. WHAT LIES BEHIND IT IS A WILLFUL DESIRE TO FLOUT THE LAW, AND IT VIOLATES THE LAW AND IT VIOLATES US BOTH LEGALLY AND MORALLY.LEGALLY, IT'S A VIOLATION OF 1054 IN BOTH SPIRIT AND LETTER OF THAT LAW. LEGALLY, IT IS IN VIOLATION OF THIS COURT'S DIRECT ORDER TO COUNSEL, AND MORALLY, IT'S A VIOLATION OF THE JURORS' RIGHT TO THE TRUTH.THEY'VE BEEN LIED TO, THEY'VE BEEN DECEIVED, THEY'VE GOTTEN HALF TRUTHS FROM COUNSEL. HE HAS DELIBERATELY SHOWN THEM ITEMS THAT WERE TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT, GIVEN THEM HALF TRUTHS, GIVEN THEM ACTUALLY PIECES OF STATEMENTS THAT LED TO A DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED REPRESENTATION OF WHAT REALLY WHAT WAS BEING STATED.AND COUNSEL IS TELLING THE COURT, ""OH, THAT'S NO BIG DEAL. IF I MISLEAD THEM, THEN THE PEOPLE CAN COME BACK IN CLOSING ARGUMENT AND READDRESS ALL THE WRONG.""COUNSEL KNOWS VERY WELL THAT WE CANNOT BECAUSE THIS IS -- OUR CLOSING ARGUMENTS ARE MONTHS DOWN THE LINE AND WELL HE KNOWS IT. COUNSEL HAS VERY CAREFULLY AND VERY CYNICALLY WEIGHED THE RISKS AND THE BENEFITS OF HIS MISCONDUCT AND HE HAS RIGHTFULLY ASSURED HIMSELF THAT THE RISKS, IF ANY AT ALL, ARE FAR OUTWEIGHED BY THE BENEFIT.THESE JURORS HAVE NOW HEARD STATEMENTS AND REPRESENTATIONS OF COUNSEL ABOUT WITNESSES THAT THE PEOPLE WERE NEVER INFORMED OF, THAT THE PEOPLE COULD HAVE ADDRESSED IN THEIR OPENING STATEMENT AND EVEN COULD HAVE CALLED IN THEIR CASE IN CHIEF IN ORDER TO SHOW THE JURORS THE KIND OF WITNESSES THAT WILL COME FORWARD IN A CASE LIKE THIS FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF GAINING CELEBRITY.AND MR. COCHRAN WILLFULLY WITHHELD THEIR NAMES KNOWING THAT WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO WAS CLOAK THEM WITH A FALSE AURA OF CREDIBILITY BEFORE THIS JURY AND SANDBAG THE PEOPLE SO THAT WE WERE UNAWARE OF THEM AND UNABLE TO ADDRESS THEM IN OUR OPENING STATEMENT.HE MADE STATEMENTS CONCERNING WITNESSES THAT MIGHT NEVER APPEAR BECAUSE OF FEAR, THEREBY CLOAKING A WITNESS WITH CREDIBILITY WHO WOULD NEVER APPEAR PROBABLY BECAUSE OF FEAR OF EXPOSURE BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT TELLING THE TRUTH. INSTEAD, NOW HE'S CREATED IDEAS AND NOTIONS IN THE MINDS OF THESE JURORS THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT WILL NOT COME FORWARD, THAT WOULD BE HOLDING THE TRUTH EXCEPT FOR THE FEAR OF HARASSMENT.AND THAT IS NOT TRUE. THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF THAT WHATSOEVER. IN FACT, WE HAVE WITNESSES COMING OUT OF THE WOODWORK WHO KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE CASE CLAIMING TO KNOW SOMETHING JUST SO THEY CAN GET INVOLVED.SO COUNSEL HAS COMMITTED NUMEROUS ACTS OF MISCONDUCT. AND FOR HIM TO TURN TO US AND SAY WE'RE TRYING TO GET INTO HIS MIND AND WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT THE TRUTH FROM COMING OUT IS OUTRAGEOUS, IS DISGUSTING AND IS APPALLING TO ME AS AN OFFICER OF THE COURT.HE KNOWS THAT IS NOT THE CASE. AND TO ALLOW THAT KIND OF STATEMENT TO BE MADE -- AND IN ESSENCE, THAT IS THE STATEMENT THAT HE MADE TO THIS JURY -- IS WORSE THAN APPALLING. IT IS NO LONGER JUST A FEAR, YOUR HONOR, THAT THE PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL IS GOING TO BE DAMAGED. IT IS A REALITY. IT HAS BEEN DAMAGED.IT'S NOT DAMAGED BEYOND REPAIR BECAUSE IF CERTAIN ADMONITIONS ARE MADE, CERTAIN SANCTIONS ARE UNDERTAKEN AND WE ARE ABLE TO PRESENT THE WITNESSES, THE TRUTH WILL COME OUT BECAUSE OUR CASE IS STRONG. AND I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT OUR CASE.WHAT I AM WORRIED ABOUT IS THE WAY THESE JURORS ARE BEING MANIPULATED SO CYNICALLY. THEY'RE BEING TOLD, FOR EXAMPLE, ""WHY DIDN'T THE PEOPLE TELL YOU ABOUT THIS WITNESS? WHY DIDN'T THE PEOPLE TELL YOU ABOUT THAT WITNESS?""THERE'S A REAL SIMPLE ANSWER FOR THAT. THEY HID THOSE WITNESSES. HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO TELL THE JURY ABOUT WITNESSES THEY NEVER TOLD US ABOUT, WITNESSES THAT THE COURT ORDERED THEM TIME AND TIME AGAIN TO DIVULGE AND WILLFULLY THEY TOLD THIS COURT THEY HAD NO SUCH WITNESSES.SEVEN MONTHS OLD THESE STATEMENTS ARE. SEVEN MONTHS OLD THESE NAMES ARE. AND ONLY ON THE VERY DAY OF HIS STATEMENT TO THE JURY DO WE FIND THEM OUT AND AT THE CLOSE OF THE DAY NO LESS.MR. DARDEN WILL ADDRESS THAT FURTHER. I AM GOING TO ADDRESS THE COURT SOLELY ON ONE ASPECT AT THIS POINT, AND THAT IS THAT WE ARE GOING TO ASK THE COURT AT FIRST BLUSH, BEFORE OPENING STATEMENTS ARE RESUMED, TO ADMONISH THE JURY, TO TELL THE JURY THAT THEY ARE TO DISREGARD THE STATEMENTS MADE NOT BY MR. COCHRAN CONCERNING THE WITNESSES THAT WERE NOT -- THAT WERE IMPROPERLY WITHHELD FROM THE PROSECUTION AND TO ADMONISH THE JURY IN EFFECT THAT THE WITHHOLDING OF THAT INFORMATION WAS MISCONDUCT, WAS IN VIOLATION OF A COURT ORDER AND IN VIOLATION OF THE LAW THAT REQUIRES BOTH SIDES TO EXCHANGE THEIR WITNESSES AND THEIR STATEMENTS.THE OTHER PROBLEM IS THAT, YOUR HONOR, I KNOW THE DEFENSE IS ARGUING, ""WELL, WE GAVE THEM THE NAMES OF THE WITNESSES."" YES. THEY GAVE US NO ADDRESS, THEY GAVE US NO PHONE NUMBER AND THEY GAVE US NO STATEMENT.HAVING A BLANK NAME ON A LIST OF 200 GIVES US NO CLUE AS TO WHAT THAT PERSON MIGHT SAY AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD BE HIGH PRIORITY IN TERMS OF OUR INVESTIGATION. THEY STAND BEFORE THIS COURT REPEATEDLY SAYING RIDICULOUS THINGS LIKE, OH, THERE IS 900 LAWYERS IN THE D.A.'S OFFICE.YEAH. THERE'S ALSO 80,000 CASES IN THE D.A.'S OFFICE. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THEY'RE NOT ALL WORKING ON SIMPSON NOR CAN THEY. AND THERE MAY BE 9,000 OFFICERS, BUT GUESS WHAT? THEY'RE NOT ALL WORKING ON THE SIMPSON INVESTIGATION EITHER. THEY CAN'T.EVERYBODY IS WAY OVERLOADED. WE HAVE TO PRIORITIZE. AND FOR THEM TO GIVE US A NAME WITH NO ADDRESS, NO PHONE NUMBER AND NO STATEMENT ON A LIST OF 200 THAT CONTAINS A LOT OF BUNK THAT WE KNOW THEY'RE NOT GOING TO CALL IS DISINGENUOUS AND A FRAUD UPON THIS COURT.WE COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE INVESTIGATED THESE PEOPLE. AND TO GIVE US THESE LATE STATEMENTS IS OUTRAGEOUS MISCONDUCT CONDUCT.SO WE ASK THAT THE JURY BE INFORMED OF THAT FACT, THAT COUNSEL'S REMARKS THAT RELATE TO THE MENTIONING OF THOSE WITNESSES EITHER BY NAME OR BY CONTENT OF THEIR STATEMENT, THAT THEY ARE ORDERED TO DISREGARD THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE MENTIONED IN DEROGATION OF A COURT ORDER.WE ARE ALSO ASKING THAT THE COURT ADMONISH THE JURY CONCERNING THE REPRESENTATIONS OF COUNSEL ABOUT WITNESSES THAT MAY NOT APPEAR DUE TO FEAR, THAT THERE'S -- THERE IS NO SUCH EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER. SUCH REMARKS MADE BY COUNSEL WERE IMPROPER AND THEY ARE STRICKEN FROM THE RECORD AND THE JURY SHOULD BE ORDERED TO DISREGARD THEM.FURTHERMORE, THE PEOPLE WILL BE REQUESTING SOME ADDITIONAL TIME TO CONDUCT INVESTIGATION ON THE NUMEROUS WITNESSES THAT WE HAVE JUST BEEN GIVEN AT THE CLOSE OF OPENING STATEMENT DAY YESTERDAY AS WELL AS THE DAY BEFORE. AND SHOULD THE COURT GRANT US THE CONTINUANCE IN WHATEVER AMOUNT OF TIME THAT IT DOES, WE WOULD ASK THAT THE COURT TO INFORM THE JURY AS TO THE REASON FOR THE NECESSITY OF THAT CONTINUANCE, THAT IT WAS NECESSITATED BY COUNSEL'S MISCONDUCT IN FAILING TO TURN OVER THE INFORMATION THAT IT WAS ORDERED TO TURN OVER BY THE COURT.MR. DARDEN WILL ADDRESS THE COURT ON THE REMAINING REQUESTS WE HAVE PERTAINING SPECIFICALLY TO EACH WITNESS AND TO OUR REQUEST TO REOPEN THE OPENING STATEMENT.

COCHRAN'S STATEMENT, PRIOR TO THAT STATEMENT THAT MORNING, THEY DIDN'T TURN IT OVER.AND THERE'S ONLY A FEW REASONS THAT THEY DIDN'T.FIRST, THEY KNEW THAT HAD THEY TURNED OVER THIS STATEMENT THIS LATE IN THE GAME, THE COURT WOULD HAVE PRECLUDED THEM FROM UTILIZING THE STATEMENT IN OPENING STATEMENT. THE COURT WOULD HAVE SANCTIONED THEM AS THEY DID US. AND THEY WERE ALSO AWARE THAT HAD THE PROSECUTION KNOWN ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR WITNESS, WE WOULD HAVE DISCREDITED HER.WE HAVE ONLY KNOWN OF THIS WITNESS 24 HOURS, AND ALREADY WE KNOW SHE HAS NINE LAWSUITS PENDING.AND THE D.A.'S OFFICE IN OUR BAD CHECK SECTION, THERE ARE $10,000 APPROXIMATELY IN BAD CHECKS THAT RELATE TO THIS PERSON.SHE HAS DEFRAUDED THE J.W. MARRIOTT CORPORATION OF $23,000 BY STAYING IN THEIR HOTEL AND NOT PAYING FOR IT.AND THERE IS MUCH MORE, MUCH, MUCH MORE REGARDING THIS WITNESS, BUT WE NEED TIME TO INVESTIGATE THIS WITNESS, YOUR HONOR.

THE COURT PRECLUDED US FROM CALLING WITNESSES IN THE ORDER THAT WE WANTED TO CALL THOSE WITNESSES SO THAT NOW THE DEFENSE HAS A HAND SO DEEP IN OUR POCKET AT THIS POINT THAT THEY'RE LITERALLY DICTATING THE ORDER IN WHICH THE WITNESSES WILL BE CALLED BY THE PROSECUTION.SUCH SANCTIONS OUGHT TO FLOW BOTH WAYS, YOUR HONOR.

KARY MULLIS, AN APPARENT DNA EXPERT ON PCR.PRIOR TO THE OPENING STATEMENT, WE RECEIVED NO STATEMENT OR REPORT REGARDING THIS WITNESS.

AND EVEN SO, WE HAVE NEVER RECEIVED ANY REPORT OR ANY STATEMENT RELEVANT TO WHAT THIS DOCTOR WOULD TESTIFY TO.WE REQUIRE TIME TO INVESTIGATE THIS WITNESS' BACKGROUND. I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT HIM, BUT I UNDERSTAND HE IS A VERY CONTROVERSIAL FIGURE IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY.WE NEED TIME TO GATHER TRANSCRIPTS OF HIS PRIOR TESTIMONY. WE NEED TIME TO REVIEW THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE, TO REVIEW HIS BACKGROUND AND HIS TRAINING.AS THE COURT IS AWARE, THAT CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT TO DO. NOT ANYONE AND NOT JUST EVERYONE CAN PERFORM A TASK LIKE THIS AS IT RELATES TO A SCIENTIST SUCH AS DR. MULLIS, AND IT IS GOING TO TAKE TIME. IT'S GOING TO TAKE ABOUT 30 DAYS.WE WOULD ASK THAT THE COURT IN ADDITION TO THE ADMONITION INSTRUCT THE JURY TO DISREGARD ANY MENTION OF THIS WITNESS. WE WOULD ASK THE COURT TO ALLOW US TO REOPEN OUR OPENING STATEMENT.AS TO DR. RON FISCHMAN, YOUR HONOR, WE ARE SOMEWHAT ACQUAINTED WITH DR. FISCHMAN. IN FACT, I'VE MET DR. FISCHMAN. BUT UNFORTUNATELY, I DIDN'T HAVE A SUBPOENA ON ME WHEN I MET HIM.I DID, HOWEVER, CAUSE A SUBPOENA TO BE ISSUED FOR DR. FISCHMAN'S APPEARANCE IN THIS CASE. WE HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTING TO SERVE DR. FISCHMAN AND TO SPEAK WITH DR. FISCHMAN SINCE DECEMBER 14.WE BELIEVE THAT IF DR. FISCHMAN WERE HONEST AND CALLED TO TESTIFY AND TESTIFIED HONESTLY, WE BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD TESTIFY THAT AS NICOLE BROWN LEFT THE RECITAL ON JUNE 12, HE OVERHEARD THIS DEFENDANT SAYING, ""I'M GOING TO GET HER. I'M GOING TO TEACH HER A LESSON,"" AND WORDS ALONG THOSE LINES.AND SO WE HAVE TELEPHONED HIM AND WE HAVE GONE TO VISIT HIM AND WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO SERVE HIM. AND ON JANUARY 19TH, 1995, OUR INVESTIGATORS WERE OUTSIDE DR. FISCHMAN'S HOME.THEY MET, THEY TOLD HIM THEY WERE THERE TO SERVE HIM WITH A SUBPOENA, AND HE TURNED AND HE RAN, AND HE RAN BACK INSIDE HIS HOUSE AND HE LOCKED THE DOOR AND HE WOULDN'T COME OUT.AND THE INVESTIGATORS PLACED A SUBPOENA IN THE MAILBOX AND SHOUTED THROUGH THE WINDOW, ""DR. FISCHMAN, CONSIDER YOURSELF SERVED.""WELL, DR. FISCHMAN SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE YESTERDAY OR HE SHOULD HAVE CALLED THE PROSECUTION TO BE PLACED ON CALL, AND HE HAS DONE NEITHER.THE DEFENSE HAS A STATEMENT FROM DR. FISCHMAN. WE DON'T HAVE IT. WE SHOULD GET IT. WE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TIME TO INVESTIGATE DR. FISCHMAN.AND THERE ARE OTHER PROBLEMS WITH DR. FISCHMAN.WHEN THE DEFENDANT WAS ARRESTED ON JUNE 17, THERE WAS A PRESCRIPTION OF XANAX, A DEPRESSANT, IN HIS BLACK BAG. THE MEDICATION APPARENTLY WAS PRESCRIBED TO DR. FISCHMAN'S MOTHER.I DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S IN THE DEFENDANT'S BAG. BUT IT'S ISSUES LIKE THAT AND THE ISSUE OF THE RECITAL THAT HAS TO BE REVIEWED AND INVESTIGATED.IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF DR. RON FISCHMAN, AND I WOULD ASK FOR THE SAME SANCTIONS, THE SAME SANCTIONS BE IMPOSED AS IT RELATES TO DR. FISCHMAN AS WE REQUESTED WITH REGARD TO MULLIS, GERCHAS AND THE OTHER WITNESSES.DR. LENORE WALKER IS A DIFFERENT ISSUE. THE DEFENSE SERVED US WITH HER CV ON JANUARY 24, BUT THEY HAD NOT PROVIDED US WITH ANY STATEMENTS OR ANY REPORTS AS THEY ARE REQUIRED TO DO UNDER THE LAW.

WALKER HAD INTERVIEWED THE DEFENDANT AND THAT SHE HAD CONDUCTED PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS.WELL, THAT'S DISCOVERABLE. IT'S DISCOVERABLE UNDER WOODS VERSUS SUPERIOR COURT AT 25 CAL.

WALKER TO TELL THE JURY WHAT SHE'S GOING TO TESTIFY TO AND IF TESTING RESULTS EXIST, IF ACTUAL TESTS EXIST, IF THERE ARE INTERVIEWS WITH THE DEFENDANT, WE HAVE A RIGHT TO ALL OF THAT.

AND I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE A RIGHT TO ACCESS -- TO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS DEFENDANT FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING, AND THAT'S AN ISSUE WE'LL TAKE UP AGAIN IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.AT ANY EVENT, IT WILL TAKE TIME TO PREPARE FOR DR. WALKER.AND THE COURT MIGHT ALSO RECALL THAT WHEN MR. COCHRAN WAS ARGUING TO THE JURY, THAT HE MENTIONED THAT DR. WALKER WAS WATCHING, WATCHING US ON TELEVISION. SO I ASSUME DR. WALKER HAS SOME NOTES, AND APPARENTLY SHE COMMUNICATED HER OPINIONS AND CONCLUSIONS TO MR. COCHRAN, WHICH MR. COCHRAN COMMUNICATED TO THE JURY.WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT. WE HAVE A RIGHT TO THAT.WE MAKE THE SAME REQUEST WITH REGARD TO SANCTIONS. STRIKE IT, TELL THE JURY TO IGNORE IT, TELL THE JURY THAT MR. COCHRAN AND THE REST OF THE DREAM TEAM HAVE VIOLATED SOME VERY, VERY BASIC AND FUNDAMENTAL DISCOVERY RULES.THE NEXT WITNESS IS MICHELLE ABUDRAHM. SHE WAS MR. SIMPSON'S MAID APPARENTLY.

WE ARE AWARE THAT HE WAS PRESENT ON JUNE 17TH. HE APPEARED BEFORE THE GRAND JURY. WE ASKED HIM WHAT HAPPENED IN MR. KARDASHIAN'S HOUSE JUST BEFORE THE DEFENDANT FLED.HE TOLD US THAT THE DEFENDANT FLED AS SOON AS HE HEARD THAT THE POLICE WERE ON THEIR WAY TO ARREST HIM. BUT WE DIDN'T ASK DR. BADEN ABOUT ANY TESTING OR THE RESULTS OF ANY TEST. WE DID NOT ASK HIM ABOUT HIS EXPERT OPINION REGARDING BLOOD OR PATHOLOGY.AND IT WAS MADE CLEAR TO US THAT SUCH TOPICS WERE OFF LIMITS, THAT HE WAS A DEFENSE EXPERT, AND THAT TO INQUIRE IN THOSE AREAS WOULD BE TO VIOLATE THE ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE, AND WE HONORED THAT.WHAT MR. COCHRAN HAS TOLD US THAT DR. BADEN WILL TESTIFY THAT THE PERPETRATOR SHOULD HAVE BEEN DRENCHED IN BLOOD.IT WOULD SEEM TO US THAT DR. BADEN HAS REVIEWED CERTAIN ITEMS AND OBJECTS, HE HAS PERHAPS CONDUCTED SOME TESTS, HE HAS RENDERED AN OPINION.WE WOULD LIKE THOSE REPORTS, WE WOULD LIKE THAT OPINION.AND THERE HAS TO BE ONE BECAUSE AS I UNDERSTAND THE RULES IN OPENING STATEMENT, COUNSEL IS NOT ALLOWED TO INFORM THE JURY OF EVIDENCE OR INFORMATION THAT THEY DO NOT IN GOOD FAITH AND REASONABLY BELIEVE WILL BE HEARD FROM THE WITNESS STAND OR IN OPENING COURT OR RECEIVED IN EVIDENCE.IF MR. COCHRAN OR THE REST OF THE DREAM TEAM HAVE HAD ORAL CONVERSATIONS WITH DR. BADEN REGARDING HIS CONCLUSIONS AND OPINIONS, THEN I WOULD ASK THE COURT TO ORDER THEM TO REDUCE THESE CONVERSATIONS TO WRITING AND THAT THEY DO IT NOW IMMEDIATELY.WE WOULD ASK THAT THE COURT IMPOSE THE SAME SANCTIONS, THE SANCTIONS WE MENTIONED EARLIER; STRIKE IT FROM THE RECORD, TELL THE JURY TO DISREGARD IT AND IGNORE IT, TELL THE JURY THAT THE DEFENSE, THE DREAM TEAM, AMERICA'S FINEST DEFENSE ATTORNEYS, TELL THE JURY THAT THESE LAWYERS HAVE COMMITTED MISCONDUCT, THEY HAVE DECEIVED THE COURT AND THAT THEY HAVE VIOLATED THE BASIC AND FUNDAMENTAL RULES OF DISCOVERY AND THAT THEY HAVE IMPINGED UPON THE PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL.NEXT IS CHRISTIAN RIECHARDT. HE IS FAYE RESNICK'S EX-FIANCE. SHE DUMPED HIM AND HE'S OUT TO GET HER. THAT'S FINE.I HAVE INTERVIEWED MR. RIECHARDT MYSELF WITH THE USE OF A COURT STENOGRAPHER IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS ATTORNEY, MR. DOMINIC RUBALCAVA, AND WE HAVE TURNED THAT OVER TO THE DEFENSE.IF THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL STATEMENT OR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT. IF THERE WERE ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS NOT REDUCED TO WRITING, WE WOULD ASK THAT THE COURT ORDER THE DEFENSE TO REDUCE THOSE CONVERSATIONS TO WRITING.IF THE DEFENSE INTENDS ONLY TO RELY ON INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED BY THE PROSECUTION AND BY THE LAPD, THEN THAT'S FINE. BUT THEY SHOULD STAND BEFORE THE COURT AND INFORM THE COURT OF THAT. IF THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO, THEN THERE'S NO SURPRISE NECESSARILY AS TO MR. RIECHARDT.BUT I WILL SAY THIS. AND THAT IS THAT NO STATEMENT HAS EVER BEEN RECEIVED FROM THE DEFENSE AS IT RELATES TO MR. RIECHARDT. IN ADDITION, MR. RIECHARDT IS NOT ON THE DEFENSE WITNESS LIST.SO MAYBE I JUMPED THE GUN ON THIS ONE, SHOULD STRIKE IT, AND HE SHOULD MOVE TO THE BACK OF THE LINE.AND WE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DO AS THE DEFENSE HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO DO TO US IN THIS CASE.

MARCUS ALLEN BECAUSE I TRAVELED TO KANSAS CITY AND I WAS PRESENT WITH THREE POLICE DETECTIVES WHEN MR. ALLEN TOLD US HE NEVER HAD AN AFFAIR WITH DENISE -- RATHER WITH NICOLE BROWN.AND SO IF IT IS MR. MARCUS ALLEN OR IF IT IS SOME OTHER PERSON, WE WOULD LIKE THE DISCOVERY, YOUR HONOR. WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE IDENTITY OF THAT PERSON.MIND YOU THAT WE DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO PROVE TO BE RELEVANT IN THIS CASE ANYWAY. BUT IN THE EVENT THAT IT DOES, COUNSEL HAS DRAGGED THIS INFORMATION IN FRONT OF THE JURY IN AN ATTEMPT TO SOIL THE REPUTATION OF THE DECEASED VICTIM.AND THAT'S FINE. THAT HAPPENS IN COURT. BUT WE HAVE A RIGHT TO THAT INFORMATION, TO THE NAME OF THAT INDIVIDUAL AND TO THAT STATEMENT, THAT INDIVIDUAL'S STATEMENT.AND IF THEY THINK THEY CAN JUST SIT THERE AND TALK TO THESE PEOPLE ON THE TELEPHONE OR IN PERSON AND NOT REDUCE THEIR CONVERSATIONS TO NOTES OR THEY THINK THEY CAN REDUCE THIS INTERVIEW TO NOTES AND THEN NOT TURN THEM OVER, WELL, THAT'S NOT THE LAW. THAT'S NOT THE LAW IN THIS STATE. AND YOU CAN'T SANDBAG THE OPPOSITION THAT WAY.AND I UNDERSTAND MR. COCHRAN WHEN HE STANDS HERE AND TELLS US HOW HE'S THE ONLY ONE INTERESTED IN THE TRUTH IN THIS CASE. AND I APPRECIATE THAT.BUT I WOULD SUGGEST TO THE COURT THAT THIS CONDUCT AS IT RELATES TO THE DISCOVERY IN THIS CASE IS COMPLETELY INCONSISTENT, COMPLETELY INCONSISTENT WITH ANY DESIRE TO DETERMINE THE TRUTH OR TO HAVE THE JURY DETERMINE THE TRUTH.AND I WOULD LIKE THE JURY TO KNOW THE TRUTH REGARDING THE MURDER OF THESE TWO PEOPLE, YOUR HONOR, WIN OR LOSE, AS LONG AS THE TRUTH COMES OUT. BUT THE TYPE OF CONDUCT EXHIBITED BY THE DEFENSE THESE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS AND OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS --I MEAN THEY HAD THE AUDACITY TO STAND HERE AND DEMAND THAT YOU SANCTION US ALL THE WHILE KNOWING THAT THEY HAD STATEMENTS, STATEMENTS FROM MATERIAL WITNESSES THAT THEY TOOK FOUR, FIVE AND SIX MONTHS PRIOR, AND THEY KNEW THEY HAD THEM, THEY KNEW THEY HADN'T TURNED THEM OVER AND THEY STOOD HERE AND ASKED YOU TO SANCTION US. THE GALL.THE COURT SHOULD IMPRESS UPON THE DEFENSE THAT THE RULES APPLY TO THEM. IT DOESN'T JUST APPLY TO THE POOR CIVIL SERVANT LAWYERS ON THE OTHER SIDE. IT APPLIES TO THE DREAM TEAM TOO AND TO THE DREAM DEFENDANT.IT ISN'T FAIR. WHAT THEY'VE DONE IN THIS COURTROOM THE PAST COUPLE DAYS IS NOT FAIR. I HAVE NEVER EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS.MR.

#MR. DARDEN: ,"YOUR HONOR, TIME AND TIME AGAIN, THE PROSECUTION STOOD BEFORE THE COURT, ADVISED THE COURT THAT THE DEFENSE WAS PLAYING FAST AND LOOSE WITH THE DISCOVERY RULES, WITH THE EVIDENCE.EACH TIME A MEMBER OF THE DREAM TEAM STEPPED TO THE PODIUM AND ADVISED THE COURT TO WHAT THEY THOUGHT THE LAW REQUIRED, THEY ADVISED THE COURT THAT THEY HAD NO DISCOVERY, THEY HAD NO REPORTS OR THEY DIDN'T INTEND TO CALL THE WITNESS OR THAT THEY HAD NO DUTY TO TURN OVER RELEVANT AND MATERIAL INFORMATION, STATEMENTS FROM MATERIAL WITNESSES THAT THEY KNEW FROM DAY ONE THEY WOULD WANT TO CALL IN THIS TRIAL, AND THEY DID THAT TIME AND TIME AGAIN. MR. DOUGLAS DID IT JUST LAST WEEK ON JANUARY 20.THE COURT MAY RECALL -- AND THIS IS AT VOLUME 73 AT PAGE 11319 WHERE MR. DOUGLAS INFORMED THE COURT:""CERTAINLY, YOUR HONOR, THE COURT UNDERSTANDS OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE DISCOVERY ACT AND CERTAINLY, YOUR HONOR, WITH THIS FINE COLLECTION OF LAWYERS, WE UNDERSTAND OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE DISCOVERY ACT.""AND I THINK THEIR UNDERSTANDING, YOUR HONOR, WAS PROBABLY CORRECT; AND THAT IS THAT THEY HAD A DUTY TO TURN OVER THE STATEMENTS OF THESE MATERIAL WITNESSES. AND I THINK THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT. I THINK THE LAW IS PRETTY CLEAR THERE.I THINK MR. UELMEN STATED IT RATHER SUCCINCTLY AND CLEARLY WHEN HE SAID IN CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE THESE WHERE TRIAL HAS ALREADY BEGUN, EACH PARTY HAS A DUTY TO TURN OVER TO THE OTHER PARTY DISCOVERABLE MATERIAL IMMEDIATELY.AND MR. UELMEN SAID TO THE COURT:""YOUR HONOR, IMMEDIATE MEANS IMMEDIATE. IT MEANS NOW. IT MEANS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.""AND THAT, AS I RECALL, WAS THE COURT'S UNDERSTANDING OF THE TERM.WELL, WE'VE BEEN IN TRIAL SINCE SEPTEMBER AS I UNDERSTAND IT. WELL, IT IS THAT SECTION OF THE DISCOVERY RULES THAT APPLIES TO THESE DEFENDANTS OR TO THIS DEFENDANT AND THESE DEFENSE ATTORNEYS.THEY SHOULD HAVE TURNED OVER THIS INFORMATION TO US IMMEDIATELY, BUT THEY DIDN'T. THEY WANTED TO SANDBAG US.HAD THEY TURNED THE INFORMATION OVER TO US LAST WEEK OR AT CHRISTMAS OR ON DECEMBER 14, AS WE DID -- THE COURT WILL RECALL THAT ON DECEMBER 14, WE TURNED OVER DISCOVERY TO DEFENSE AND YOU HAD TO PULL THEM OFF THE CEILING.IT'S SIX WEEKS LATER NOW. THE SANCTIONS THE COURT IMPOSED ON US BACK ON SEPTEMBER 23RD AND EARLIER ARE STILL IN EFFECT.THEY'VE HAD SIX WEEKS TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION; AND IN THAT SIX WEEKS, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DID IN TERMS OF AN INVESTIGATION. BUT IN THAT SIX WEEKS, THEY CERTAINLY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO THINK ABOUT THE ISSUE OF DISCOVERY.I MEAN THEY FILED A 40-PAGE BRIEF ON THE SUBJECT. THEY ARGUED IT TO THE COURT DAY AFTER DAY. THEY UNDERSTAND THE LAW AND THEY UNDERSTAND THE RULES. THEY KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TURN OVER DISCOVERY TO US AFTER MR. COCHRAN HAS MENTIONED THE CONTENT OF THAT DISCOVERY BEFORE THE JURY ALREADY.THEY KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A DUTY TO TURN OVER INFORMATION TO US IMMEDIATELY. BUT THEY DIDN'T DO THAT. THEY DIDN'T DO IT LAST YEAR, THEY DIDN'T DO IT LAST MONTH, THEY DIDN'T EVEN DO IT THE MORNING BEFORE MR. COCHRAN BEGAN HIS OPENING STATEMENT.AND THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS. THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS.AND THEY DIDN'T DO IT BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT HAD THEY DONE IT, YOU WOULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED MR. COCHRAN TO POISON THE MINDS OF THESE JURORS WITH HEARSAY ON TOP OF HEARSAY WITH THE CONTENT OF STATEMENTS GIVEN HIM BY WITNESSES WHO ARE COMPLETELY UNRELIABLE AND WHOSE BACKGROUND I AM SURE THAT IF MR. COCHRAN KNEW OR WAS AWARE, HE WOULD NOT HAVE EVEN MENTIONED THEM.WHEN THE VOTERS IN THIS STATE PASSED PROPOSITION 115, THERE WAS A CLEAR MANDATE, AND THAT MANDATE WAS, NO MORE SANDBAGGING, NO MORE SLEAZY TRIAL TACTICS, NO MORE ABUSE OF THE PROCESS OR OF THE SYSTEM OR OF THE COURTS.AS THE COURT ALREADY ALLUDED TO EARLIER, DISCOVERY BECAME A TWO-WAY STREET. I DON'T KNOW WHY THE DREAM TEAM CAN'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT OR GRASP THAT OR WHY THEY DON'T WANT TO FOLLOW THE RULES.I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE A CELEBRITY CLIENT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS ALLEGEDLY THE BIGGEST MURDER CASE EVER. BUT THE RULES DON'T STOP JUST FOR THIS CASE. THE RULES APPLY TO THIS CASE.HAD WE DONE WHAT THEY DID, I SHUDDER TO THINK WHAT THE COURT WOULD HAVE DONE TO OUR CASE, BECAUSE EVEN DESPITE OUR INNOCENT AND NEGLIGENT MISTAKES IN TERMS OF DISCOVERY, YOU'VE GUTTED OUR CASE TO SOME EXTENT.

IT IS MY SINCERE HOPE, YOUR HONOR, TO BRING DIGNITY TO THE PROFESSION THAT I LOVE, SO I WILL NOT DIGNIFY THE OFTEN VILE, INSIDIOUS AND LONG-WINDED COMMENTS BY MY COLLEAGUE BY RESPONDING IN KIND.YOUR HONOR, I HAVE KNOWN CHRISTOPHER DARDEN FOR WELL OVER TEN YEARS AND HE HAS REFERRED IN FACT TO ME AND TO MY OFFICE THE PARENTS OF A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS ONCE SHOT AND KILLED WHILE GOING HOME FROM SCHOOL, SO I CANNOT FATHOM THAT HE WOULD HAVE ENTRUSTED THAT FAMILY IN MY CARE IF HE BELIEVED THAT I OR MY COLLEAGUES WERE AS DISHONEST AND AS UNETHICAL AS HE HAS INFERRED.YOUR HONOR, HE COMES TO YOU SEEKING EQUITY. HE COMES TO YOU ASKING ABOUT BASIC FAIRNESS.AS THE COURT IS AWARE, THERE IS A CONCEPT IN EQUITY CALLED CLEAN HANDS AND THAT CONCEPT SAYS THAT ONE CANNOT SEEK EQUITY WITHOUT DOING EQUITY IN KIND.AND I SUBMIT TO THE COURT THAT BEFORE MR. DARDEN COMES AND SEEKS EQUITY THE TRUE RECORD SHOULD BE CONSIDERED SO THAT THE COURT CAN WEIGH AND PROPERLY BALANCE A RESPONSE, GIVEN THE CURRENT STATE OF THE FULL RECORD.YOUR HONOR, IN SEPTEMBER OF 1994 THE PROSECUTORS GAVE THE DEFENDANTS A LIST OF 214 NAMES. ON JANUARY THE 6TH OF 1995 THE PROSECUTORS GAVE THE DEFENDANTS 207 ADDITIONAL NAMES.FIVE MORE WERE ADDED THE FOLLOWING WEEK; THREE MORE WERE ADDED AFTER THAT; TWO MORE WERE ADDED SINCE THEN.THE FIRST OF HIS COMPLAINTS WERE BASED ON THE THOUGHT THAT THE DEFENSE HAD SOMEHOW DUMPED NAMES WITHOUT ADDRESSES OR PHONE NUMBERS ON THE PROSECUTION AND HOW UNFAIR THAT WAS TO THE PROSECUTION.I GIVE THIS COURT AT THIS TIME THE NAMES OF ART SHAFFMAN, BHARAT SHAW, JOSEPH PERULLI, ELISA PEREZ, CINDY PATTERSON, BRET LOBNER, MARK LEON, RAY KILDUFF, BO JACKSON, CARLOS HERNANDEZ, RICHARD GONZALEZ, DON DETZLER, CAROL DIPRIMA, JAY SWELL, VITO BOFFA, NICOLAS BOLLAS, DONNA ESTES, GARY KAWAKAWI, AMANDA DARLING, PATRICK -- PATRICIA FOY, DAVID PRESTHOLT, CRUZ PRIEGO, R.

#MR. DOUGLAS: ,"FROM JONATHAN FAIRTLOUGH, FROM SCOTT GORDON, FROM LYDIA BODIN OR FROM ANY OTHER ATTORNEY, CHERI LEWIS, MISS KAHN OR ANYONE ELSE WHO HAS OBVIOUSLY HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER WITNESSES.AS WELL, YOUR HONOR, THERE HAVE BEEN AT LEAST TWELVE DNA EXPERTS THAT HAVE BEEN NOTICED BY BOTH SIDES, KARY MULLIS, I STRONGLY BELIEVE WAS ONE OF THE NAMES THAT WERE INCLUDED IN OUR LIST OF EXPERTS THAT THEY ARE AWARE OF, AND I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ONE DNA REPORT FROM ANY OF THESE EXPERTS BASED ON TESTIMONY THAT THEY INTEND TO OFFER IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE.SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT FAIRNESS, BUT WE MUST ALSO REMEMBER THAT BOTH SIDES MUST HAVE CLEAN HANDS.THE CASE, YOUR HONOR, BEGAN BACK IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR. WE HAVE ENLISTED SEVERAL ATTORNEYS WHO WORK OUT OF DIFFERENT OFFICES. AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER WE HAVE USED SEVEN DIFFERENT -- SIX DIFFERENT INVESTIGATORS THAT WERE INVOLVED IN DIFFERENT PIECES OF INVESTIGATION. THEY DID NOT ALWAYS WORK IN CONCERT, THEY DID NOT ALWAYS SHARE THEIR WORK PRODUCT WITH EACH OF THE OTHER INVESTIGATORS OR WITH EACH OF THE OTHER ATTORNEYS.ONE OF THE ITEMS THAT WERE TURNED OVER YESTERDAY WAS A WITNESS STATEMENT OF MARY ANNE GERCHAS. THAT WITNESS STATEMENT WAS OBTAINED BY AN INVESTIGATOR WITH WHOM I PERSONALLY HAVE NEVER SPOKE.THAT IS AN INVESTIGATOR WHO BASICALLY HAS DONE LIMITED WORK ON THIS CASE, AND UNBEKNOWNST TO ME, ONE OF THE JOBS THAT HE PERFORMED WAS TO INTERVIEW AND TO OBTAIN A STATEMENT OF MARY ANNE GERCHAS.I REPRESENT AS AN OFFICER OF THIS COURT THAT THE FIRST DAY THAT I PERSONALLY BECAME AWARE OF THE EXISTENCE OF HIS STATEMENT BETWEEN OF MISS GERCHAS WAS MOMENTS BEFORE I TOOK THE PODIUM YESTERDAY WHEN MR. COCHRAN GAVE ME A COPY AND I ASKED YOUR CLERK TO MAKE COPIES SO THAT I CAN READ MYSELF.CERTAINLY, YOUR HONOR, I RECOGNIZED, IF YOU WILL, YESTERDAY THAT THAT WAS A VIOLATION TO HAVE NOT TURNED THAT STATEMENT OVER, BUT IF THE COURT WERE TO READ THAT STATEMENT, THE COURT WOULD SEE THAT MISS GERCHAS HAD CONTACTED THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND SPOKE TO PATTY FAIRBANKS IN THAT OFFICE, THAT MISS FAIRBANKS TOLD MISS GERCHAS THAT I'M TALKING LONG DISTANCE TO A PSYCHIC SO THAT I WILL HAVE TO CALL YOU BACK, THAT IN HER DESPAIR MISS GERCHAS CONTACTED THE POLICE DEPARTMENT GIVING THEM INFORMATION THAT WAS BROUGHT BEFORE THE JURY YESTERDAY, THAT MISS GERCHAS' NAME, ADDRESS AND TELEPHONE NUMBER WERE INCLUDED ON THE WITNESS LIST THAT WE PROVIDED IN AUGUST OF 1994.SO CERTAINLY, YOUR HONOR, WHILE THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM WITH OUR PHYSICALLY TURNING OVER HER STATEMENT, THE SURPRISE, THE ABSOLUTE SHOCK AND AMAZEMENT THAT HAS BEEN OFFERED HERE IS SOMEWHAT OVERBLOWN.FOR EXAMPLE, YOUR HONOR, NOT ONLY DID WE GIVE THE NAME OF ROSA LOPEZ, WE GAVE HER ADDRESS AS BEING A LOCATION DIRECTLY NEXT DOOR TO WHERE MR. SIMPSON LIVED. NOT ONLY DID WE GIVE HER NAME AND HER ADDRESS, BUT WE GAVE HER STATEMENT AS WELL.DESPITE HAVING HER NAME, HER ADDRESS, HER TELEPHONE NUMBER AND A STATEMENT, THERE WAS NO REPRESENTATIVE FROM EITHER THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE OR THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT TO INTERVIEW ROSA LOPEZ --

#MR. DOUGLAS: ,"YOUR HONOR, I AM SIMPLY, BY ANALOGY, HOPING TO OFFER TO THE COURT THAT THE PROTESTATIONS OF PREJUDICE ARE PERHAPS NOT IN GOOD FAITH, BECAUSE THOUGH THEY HAD THE VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION, ROSA LOPEZ, THEY NEVER SAW FIT TO GO AND INTERVIEW HER UNTIL MONDAY EVENING WHEN MR. BAILEY STOOD UP AND EXPLAINED TO THIS COURT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF HER TESTIMONY.I OFFER THAT TO SAY, YOUR HONOR, THAT YES, THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SOME FACIAL VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE; HOWEVER, BEFORE THE COURT BELIEVES THAT THERE HAS BEEN DIRE PREJUDICE YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE EQUITY, YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE CLEAN HANDS AND THAT IS WHAT I SEEK TO OFFER TO THE COURT.NOW, YOUR HONOR, THERE HAS IN FACT BEEN A LIST GIVEN YESTERDAY BECAUSE THE COURT MADE IT VERY CLEAR ON MONDAY THAT I WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH -- I'M SORRY, ON TUESDAY -- MONDAY WHEN I GAVE THE NAMES OF SUPPLEMENTAL WITNESSES I TOLD THE COURT THAT THESE WERE THE STATEMENTS THAT WERE ATTACHED AND THERE WERE, I BELIEVE, SEVERAL NAMES AND SIX STATEMENTS THAT WERE ATTACHED.THERE WAS ONE NAME IN PARTICULAR, SCOTT MATSUDA THAT THE PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT AND THAT THEY KNEW THAT THERE HAD BEEN A STATEMENT OF AND THAT STATEMENT WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY FORTHCOMING BECAUSE IT WAS NOT ATTACHED IN THAT PACKET.I THEN MADE A CALL AND THE NEXT DAY THAT NAME AND THAT STATEMENT WAS GIVEN TO THE PEOPLE. IT WAS ON TUESDAY THAT THE COURT DIRECTED ME SPECIFICALLY TO GO THROUGH MY ENTIRE RECORDS AND TO MAKE SURE THAT I HAVE COMPLETELY SATISFIED MYSELF, THAT I HAVE GONE THROUGH AND FOUND OUT EVERYTHING THAT HAS NOT BEEN TURNED OVER AND WE DID AN EXHAUSTIVE PROCESS, YOUR HONOR, AND WE FOLLOWED THROUGH WITH THE COURT'S WARNINGS AND THE COURT'S DIRECTIONS AND THAT WAS HOW WE WERE ABLE TO FIND OUT THAT THERE WERE TWELVE STATEMENTS THAT HAD FALLEN THROUGH THE CRACK.TWELVE STATEMENTS OUT OF HUNDREDS OF NAMES THAT WERE GIVEN BY THE PROSECUTION AND HUNDREDS OF NAMES THAT WERE PROVIDED BY THE DEFENSE.NOW, YOUR HONOR, OF THESE TWELVE INDIVIDUALS, WHOM STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED, THERE ARE FIVE WHOM I REASONABLY EXPECT THAT I WILL BE OFFERING TESTIMONY AT TRIAL.THEREFORE, YOUR HONOR, WHEN THE COURT CONSIDERS THE PROPRIETY OF A SANCTION, THE COURT SHOULD DO SO WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF REALITY. IT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH JUSTICE OR FAIRNESS TO CRY OUT NUMBERS OR TO CALL OUT NAMES WITHOUT KNOWING IN ACTUALITY THE IMPACT THAT IS GOING TO HAVE ON THIS TRIAL.AND YOUR HONOR, IT CANNOT BE IGNORED THAT THIS IS JANUARY 26, THE START OF THE BEGINNING OF THE CASE. IT IS A DAY WHEN TYPICALLY IN PREPARATION FOR THE TRIAL THE LAWYERS HUDDLE TOGETHER, THE LAWYERS REVIEW THE STATE OF THE RECORD, THE LAWYERS REVIEW THE STATE OF ALL OF THE PRETRIAL ARGUMENTS AND RULINGS AND GET TOGETHER AND DECIDE WHOM WE NOW REASONABLY EXPECT TO CALL, AND WE DID THAT.AND EVEN ON DOING THAT, YOUR HONOR, WE OMITTED THE NAME OF RON FISCHMAN, WE OMIT THE NAMES OF CHRISTIAN RIECHARDT, AND THOSE NAMES WILL BE SOON ADDED, BUT THE PEOPLE HAVE ADDED NAMES THIS VERY WEEK AND WE ARE ALREADY BEGINNING. THEIR CASE SHOULD HAVE BEEN TODAY, PERHAPS WILL BE TOMORROW, BUT THEY, TOO, HAVE STILL ADDED NAMES.YOUR HONOR, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FIVE INDIVIDUALS WHOM WE REASONABLY BELIEVE THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO CALL, IT IS MY OPINION THAT ONLY TWO OF THOSE NAMES ARE NAMES THAT ARE UNKNOWN TO THE PROSECUTION.AND YOUR HONOR, THEY TALK ABOUT HOW THEY HAVE BEEN SANDBAGGED, YET IN 24 HOURS THEY HAVE ATTEMPTED TO ASSASSINATE THE CHARACTER OF MARY ANNE GERCHAS, ONE OF OUR WITNESSES, BY SUGGESTING ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE TOTALLY UNTRUE.AND YOUR HONOR, MR. COCHRAN WILL DEAL WITH THAT MORE WHEN HE COMES UP, BUT YOUR HONOR, THERE IS A TREMENDOUSLY AFFECTIVE WHEEL THAT IS ALREADY IN PLACE CALLED THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THERE IS ANOTHER COG IN THAT WHEEL CALLED THE LOS ANGELES DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, AND ALTHOUGH THEY MAY HAVE BEEN GIVEN SHORT TIME TO ADEQUATELY INVESTIGATE SOME OF THE NAMES, THEY HAVE DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB IN 24 HOURS, AND I DARE SAY THEY WILL BE ABLE TO DO A MUCH BETTER JOB IN THE TWO MONTHS' TIME IT IS GOING TO TAKE AT A MINIMUM BEFORE WE BEGIN CALLING ANY WITNESSES ON THE DEFENSE.YOUR HONOR, IF THIS WERE THE FIRST DAY OF THE DEFENDANT'S CASE AND WE WERE THEN INTENDING TO CALL MARY ANNE GERCHAS OR RON FISCHMAN OR CHRISTIAN RIECHARDT I WOULD NOT BE MAKING THE SAME ARGUMENTS TO THIS COURT BECAUSE I WOULD RECOGNIZE THAT THERE WOULD REALLY BE A CLEAR PREJUDICE.BUT WHEN WE HAVE 400 NAMES ON A WITNESS LIST AND WHEN WE HAVE A SIX-MONTH TRIAL ESTIMATE AND WHEN WE HAVE THE EXPECTATION THAT THERE WILL BE DOZENS AND SCORES OF WITNESSES CALLED, I ALSO BELIEVE THIS COURT MAY FASHION A MORE EQUITABLE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM, A MORE EQUITABLE RESPONSE TO OUR MISTAKES, RECOGNIZING THAT THESE LAWYERS WHOM YOU ALSO KNOW, WHOM YOU ALSO HAVE SOME ADMIRATION FOR AND RESPECT FOR, WHOM YOU ALSO BELIEVE, WOULD NOT MALICIOUSLY OR IN BAD FAITH ATTEMPT TO SANDBAG OR DO ALL OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN ALLEGED.I THINK CERTAINLY, YOUR HONOR, YOU DON'T COME INTO THIS POSITION IN A VACUUM AND CERTAINLY I THINK YOU CAN UNDERSTAND, GIVEN THE MASSIVE SIZE OF THIS CASE, GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF ISSUES, GIVEN ALL OF THE WITNESSES WHO WILL BE CALLED, THAT IT IS LIKELY THAT THINGS FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS.NOW, YOUR HONOR, THE PEOPLE STOOD UP HERE IN DECEMBER AND TRIED TO TELL YOU ALL OF THE REASONS WHY THEY MADE CERTAIN MISTAKES AND THE COURT SAID THAT THE CODE REQUIRED THAT THEY IMMEDIATELY DISCLOSE AND THAT THEY HADN'T DONE SO IMMEDIATELY AND THAT THE COURT THEN ISSUED A SANCTION WHICH THE COURT FELT WAS APPROPRIATE.I THINK THE COURT SHOULD DO THE SAME SORT OF BALANCING TODAY, BECAUSE ON DECEMBER THE 14TH, OR WHENEVER THAT HEARING WAS, OPENING STATEMENTS WERE DUE TO BEGIN THE FOLLOWING MONTH. WE HAVE AT LEAST TWO MONTHS NOW BEFORE WE ARE EVEN GOING TO CALL ANY OF THE DEFENDANT'S WITNESSES.YOUR HONOR, MARY ANNE GERCHAS IS A NAME, AS I SUGGEST, THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY KNEW OF. HER STATEMENT TAKEN IN JULY GIVES THE NAME OF PATTY FAIRBANKS OR PATTY FAIR SOMETHING, CLEARLY SUGGESTING THAT SHE HAD HAD CONTACT WITH SOMEONE IN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE.MICHELLE ABUDRAHM, WHO IS ANOTHER NAME ON OUR LIST WITH A STATEMENT TURNED OVER YESTERDAY, IS ALSO A PERSON WITH WHOM THEY ARE AWARE. THEY HAVE INTERVIEWED OTHER WITNESSES ABOUT THE FAIR -- ABOUT MISS ABUDRAHM AND ABOUT THE ALLEGATIONS THAT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON STRUCK HER PRIOR TO HER LEAVING THE SIMPSON HOME.JOEL PITCOFF, WHO WAS AN EMPLOYEE OF FORD, IS A WITNESS WHO WE INTEND TO CALL WHO IS PROBABLY UNKNOWN TO THE PROSECUTION, AND ON THAT ONE I WOULD ACCEPT THE SANCTION OF ALLOWING THEM TO ADEQUATELY PROVIDE OR PERFORM BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION AND BACKGROUND RESEARCH AND TRY TO CHALLENGE THE STRENGTH OF THE NUMBERS THAT HE IS GOING TO OFFER AND REQUIRE US TO WAIT AND RECEIVE PERMISSION FROM THIS COURT BEFORE WE MENTION HIS NAME OR BEFORE WE CALL MR. PITCOFF AS A WITNESS IN THIS CASE.KEVIN WHELAN, THE COURIER, IS ANOTHER PERSON WHO WE RESPECTFULLY BELIEVE WAS IN FACT UNKNOWN TO THE PEOPLE AND SIMILARLY IT WOULD BE MEASURED AND PROPER FOR THE COURT TO IMPOSE THAT SORT OF A SANCTION.MARK PARTRIDGE IS THE FIFTH OF THE NAMES THAT I GAVE WITNESS STATEMENTS FOR YESTERDAY WHOM WE DO INTEND TO CALL, BUT YOUR HONOR, WHEN I REVIEWED MY LIST THIS MORNING, I SAW THAT THERE WAS A ONE-PAGE STATEMENT OF MR. PARTRIDGE THAT WAS TURNED OVER IN AUGUST. WHAT I TURNED OVER YESTERDAY WAS TWO ADDITIONAL PAGES, SO THEREFORE THEY CANNOT COMPLAIN TO THIS COURT THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW MR. PARTRIDGE AND THAT THEY WERE NOT AWARE OF WHAT EVIDENCE HE WOULD OFFER IN THIS CASE. SO IT WOULD NOT BE PROPER OR FAIR TO INCLUDE HIM WITH THE OTHER FOUR NAMES.RON FISCHMAN, YOUR HONOR, IS A FRIEND OF MR. SIMPSON. WHEN WE GO DOWN TO LOOK UP OR GO DOWN TO COUNTY JAIL AND HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH MR. SIMPSON AND WE TAKE NOTES DURING THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND WE WILL ASK HIM ABOUT WHAT WOULD RON FISCHMAN SAY AND RON FISCHMAN MAY MAKE CERTAIN COMMENTS OR MR. SIMPSON MAY MAKE CERTAIN COMMENTS ABOUT WHAT HE BELIEVES RON FISCHMAN WILL SAY OR JOE STELLINI WILL SAY OR LOUIS MARKS WILL SAY, YOUR HONOR, WHEN WE ARE THINKING ABOUT CALLING WITNESSES WEEKS OR MONTHS IN ADVANCE, WE DO NOT HAVE TIME TO SPEND ON LIMITED RESOURCES, AND THEY ARE IN FACT LIMITED, FOR INVESTIGATOR TIME.AND THERE ARE TWO INVESTIGATORS NOW ONLY WORKING ON MR. SIMPSON'S BEHALF ON A FULL-TIME BASIS TO TRY TO TRACK DOWN FRIENDLY FAVORABLE WITNESSES WHOM WE WILL NOT CALL FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWO MONTHS OR SO.AND THEREFORE, BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT TO BE SANCTIONED BY PRECLUSION, WE THEN PUT THEIR NAMES ON THE WITNESS LIST, AND SOMETIMES, YOUR HONOR, WE PUT THE NAMES ON THE WITNESS LIST BEFORE WE EVEN HAVE A COPY OF THE ADDRESS OR THE TELEPHONE NUMBER BECAUSE WE EXPECT REASONABLY AND FAIRLY THAT THEY WILL BE CALLED AS WITNESSES AND THAT BY THE TIME IT IS RELEVANT AND NECESSARY WE WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE CONTINUING DISCOVERY, BECAUSE IT IS IN FACT A CONTINUING PROCESS.YOUR HONOR, THERE ARE OCCASIONS WHEN WE HAVE INTERVIEWED OR SPOKEN WITH -- MR. COCHRAN WOULD SPEAK TO, FOR EXAMPLE, HENRY LEE, BARBARA WOLF, MICHAEL BADEN. THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ON THEIR WITNESS LIST, THEY ARE AWARE OF THE NAMES, AND I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE CITED A CASE THAT ARGUES THAT WHEN A LAWYER SPEAKS TO AN EXPERT ABOUT SOMETHING THAT THE LAWYER MAY SAY IN HIS OPENING STATEMENT OR ABOUT A PROPER RESPONSE TO THE SUGGESTIONS IN THE PEOPLE'S OPENING THAT BY THAT CONVERSATION ALONE HE IS REQUIRED TO REDUCE THAT CONVERSATION TO A DISCOVERABLE DOCUMENT AND THEN IMMEDIATELY TURN IT OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE.THAT IS NOT THE OBLIGATIONS EVEN UNDER PROP 115 OR THE U.S. CONSTITUTION OR THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION, YOUR HONOR, BECAUSE THIS MAN STILL HAS FIFTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS THAT STILL SURVIVE EVEN PROP 115.YOUR HONOR, THEY TALK ABOUT NOT KNOWING ABOUT DR. KARY MULLIS, THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNER. I REPRESENT TO THE COURT THAT DR. MULLIS WAS A WITNESS IN THE WINN CASE, A CASE WHERE MR. ROBERT BLASIER WAS A DEFENSE ATTORNEY IN, A CASE WITH SOME OF THE SAME DNA ISSUES AND A CASE WHICH MR. BLASIER WON AND THE COURT DECIDED THAT DNA WAS NOT ADEQUATELY RELIABLE TO BE ADMITTED INTO A CRIMINAL CASE.THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IS AWARE OF THAT, AND YOUR HONOR, I BELIEVE THAT IF MR. DARDEN WERE TO CHECK WITH MR. WOODY CLARK AND MR. ROCK HARMON, THAT HE WOULD LEARN THAT THEY HAVE ATTEMPTED TO OBTAIN MR. MULLIS' TESTIMONY IN THAT PARTICULAR CASE, THAT INDEED MR. HARMON SOUGHT TO BE INTRODUCED AS A SPECIAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN THAT CASE TO HELP CROSS-EXAMINE SOME OF THE DEFENDANT'S EXPERTS, SO FOR THEM TO SAY THAT LO AND BEHOLD THEY DIDN'T KNOW THAT, THEY ARE SURPRISED, I SUGGEST TO THE COURT IS NOT TOTALLY WITH GOOD FAITH.

AND I SAID ""YES"" AND THERE WAS NO REPORT.BUT ON JANUARY 24, IN PART BECAUSE HIS HONOR GAVE THOSE WORDS TO ME, I HAD MY INVESTIGATOR INTERVIEW MR. BUCCOLLA. THAT INTERVIEW TOOK PLACE ON JANUARY 24TH AND THE DOCUMENT WAS FAXED TO OUR COURTROOM FAX AT 4:16 P.M.

COCHRAN: ,"THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR, AGAIN.WITH REGARD TO THIS -- I TRIED TO ADDRESS THE THINGS THEY SAID IN THEIR OPENING STATEMENT, AND I FELT THEY SAID A NUMBER OF OUTRAGEOUS THINGS THAT THEY COULDN'T PROVE BY ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION, BUT I DIDN'T STAND UP -- I DIDN'T COME CRYING TO YOU THAT NIGHT AND SAID, LOOK, JUDGE, HE KNOW, HE CAN'T PROVE THOSE THINGS, HE CAN'T PROVE THOSE THINGS OF DOMESTIC DISCORD HE TALKED ABOUT, THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE -- BECAUSE WE DON'T TRY CASES THAT WAY, JUDGE.I WILL JUST WAIT UNTIL I GET MY CHANCE TO TELL THE JURY WHAT I THINK AND THEN I WILL DEAL WITH THE EVIDENCE. IT IS THE EVIDENCE THAT WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT IN THIS CASE.NOW, CERTAINLY FOR ANYONE TO STAND HERE AND SAY THAT AFTER 32 YEARS OF PRACTICE THAT I WOULD IN ANY WAY JEOPARDIZE MY REPUTATION OR DO SOMETHING UNTOWARD IN A CASE, I WOULD NEVER DO THAT. I WOULD NEVER EVER DO THAT.WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE -- AND I WOULDN'T STAND UP AS MISS CLARK DID AND TELL THE JURY THAT ALLAN PARK SAYS HE SAW A BRONCO PARKED THERE. I DIDN'T JUMP ON THAT. I JUST CAME BACK AND READ WHAT HE SAID. I DON'T HAVE TO CALL ANYBODY A LIAR.I THINK IN THIS CASE THAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH THEM. THEY ALWAYS WANT TO LABEL EVERYBODY. I WOULD MUCH PREFER READING THE TESTIMONY AND THEN I THINK IT MAKES IT CLEAR. THAT IS WHAT I THINK WE WILL BE DOING OR TRYING TO DO.NOW, THEY MAKE A BIG THING ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT I SAID AND IT TURNS OUT, JUDGE, WITH REGARD TO THE THINGS I TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY, THAT DAN MANDEL AND ELLEN ARRONSON, VERY WELL-KNOWN TO THEM, THEY HAVE ALL THE REPORTS. THEY TALKED TO THEM, WE HAD TALKED TO THEM. TOM LANG, THEY TALKED TO HIM, WE HAD TALKED TO HIM. MR. DOUGLAS POINTS OUT ROSA LOPEZ, THEY TALKED TO HIM, WE HAD TALKED TO HIM.MR. DOUGLAS HAS EXPLAINED THE SITUATION WITH MARY ANNE GERCHAS, AND I APOLOGIZE TO THE COURT FOR THAT. CERTAINLY I HAD THOUGHT THAT HAD BEEN TURNED OVER. THE LAST THING IN MY MIND TO TRY TO DO THAT.BUT I WANT TO TELL THE COURT SOMETHING ABOUT THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF COUNSEL AND WHY WE NEED TO BE PROFESSIONAL.DURING THE BREAK WE RECEIVED A CALL IN THIS COURTROOM FROM MARY ANNE GERCHAS' LAWYER. SHE WAS SO DISTRAUGHT, SHE IS TOTALLY DISTRAUGHT AT HAVING BEEN CALLED A THIEF ON TELEVISION BY MR. DARDEN -- HE SHOULD BE REAL HAPPY THAT HE MADE THESE STATEMENTS WITHIN THIS COURTROOM. HER LAWYERS ARE INCENSED. THIS WOMAN IS VERY, VERY, VERY UPSET. SHE SAYS IT'S ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE AND WHAT SHE SAID IS THE TRUTH. I MEAN, IT IS IRONIC AND OUTRAGEOUS THAT THEY WOULD DO THAT.IT SEEMS TO ME THEN THAT WHENEVER THEY STAND UP TO TALK, JUDGE, IT HAS TO BE CHARACTER ASSASSINATION, WHETHER IT IS O.J. SIMPSON, WHETHER IT IS MARY ANNE GERCHAS, WHETHER IT IS AT THE END OF THIS MORNING WHERE HE STANDS UP AND SAYS EVERYBODY ON OUR LIST IS A LIAR, A THIEF OR A FELON.ISN'T THAT INTERESTING, JUDGE, THAT ANYBODY THAT THEY DON'T CALL, YOU KNOW, BECOMES SOME VERY BAD PERSON. I DON'T THINK YOU CONDUCT YOURSELF THAT WAY AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT HOW WE APPEAR AND HOW THIS SYSTEM APPEARS AROUND THE COUNTRY.NOW, MORE SPECIFICALLY, I HAVE INDICATED TO THE COURT ABOUT MARY ANNE GERCHAS AND THE COURT -- MR. DOUGLAS HAS TALKED ABOUT KARY MULLIS. THERE IS NO CONFUSION THERE. THERE IS NO CONFUSION WITH THE PEOPLE REGARDING CORA AND RON FISCHMAN. THEY KNOW ALL THESE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY ALL RAN AROUND TOGETHER, YOUR HONOR.AND IF WE INADVERTENTLY LEFT THEIR NAME OFF, WE APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. I ASSUMED THOSE NAMES HAD BEEN TAKEN CARE OF. MY JOB HAS NOT BEEN THAT ASPECT OF IT. I AM NOT TRYING TO SHY AWAY FROM IT, BUT EVERYBODY HAS RESPONSIBILITIES AND ROLES, AND SO CAN'T DO EVERYTHING, BUT WE WANT TO ADHERE TO THAT.CERTAINLY IT IS OUTRAGEOUS FOR ANYONE TO SAY THAT WE THINK WE ARE ABOVE ANYTHING. I PRACTICED LAW IN THE COURTS OF THIS COUNTY FOR 32 OR 33 YEARS. I AM THE BLUE COLLAR LAWYER THAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT, EXCEPT YOU SEE I WAS ON THAT SIDE FOR ALMOST HALF THE TIME AND I'VE BEEN OUT HERE EARNING A LIVING THE REST OF THE TIME.AND SO I UNDERSTAND BOTH SIDES. I UNDERSTAND. NOW, ONE OF THESE DAYS WHEN THEY GET UP ENOUGH NERVE AND COME ON THIS SIDE, THEY WILL UNDERSTAND, JUDGE, THAT IT IS TOUGH WHEN YOU HAVE TO RUN YOUR OWN PRACTICE.

#MR. COCHRAN: ,"AND MARCIA WAS THERE FOR A SHORT TIME, YES, SHE WAS, TO HER CREDIT, BUT NOT AS LONG AS WE'VE BEEN HERE AND SHE'D UNDERSTAND WHAT MR. DOUGLAS WAS TRYING TO SAY -- AND I WANT TO CLARIFY THIS IS -- AS BEING A LITTLE OLDER AND LITTLE CALMER, THAT THERE IS THIS PHILOSOPHICAL THING, AND I WANT TO POINT IT OUT TO YOUR HONOR, AND YOU -- THE OTHER DAY WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION -- WE TALKED ABOUT DEFENSE LAWYERS AND THEIR ROLE AND YOU SAID YOU HAVE BEEN A DEFENSE LAWYER.WHEN I GO TO THE JAIL AND I TALK TO MY CLIENT, AND HE TELLS ME SOMETHING, I DON'T HAVE ANY OBLIGATION TO TELL THEM THAT, JUDGE. IF I KNOW THAT HE HAS RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, IF I KNOW THAT HE HAD TROUBLE SHUFFLING CARDS ON JUNE 12, THERE IS NO REPORT ON THAT, JUDGE. AS MR. DOUGLAS SAYS, IF I TALKED TO HOWARD WEITZMAN, WHOM I HAVE KNOWN FOR THIRTY YEARS, WE REPRESENTED MICHAEL JACKSON TOGETHER, IF I TALK TO HIM AND I KNOW WHAT HE AND SKIP TAFT WILL SAY, THERE IS NO REPORT ON THAT.I DON'T THINK YOU'D REQUIRE THAT, IN THE MIDST OF EVERYTHING ELSE, TO SIT DOWN AND WRITE A REPORT REGARDING THAT.NOW, THEY KNOW HOWARD WEITZMAN WAS DOWN THERE. THEY KNOW SKIP TAFT WAS THERE. THIS IS NO SURPRISE, JUDGE. WHAT HAPPENED, JUDGE, YESTERDAY -- AND I WANT YOU TO PUT THIS IN -- IN PERSPECTIVE, WAS FINALLY SOMEBODY FROM THE DEFENSE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO STAND UP AND TELL THE FACTS AS WE UNDERSTOOD THEM.IF THEY DON'T LIKE THOSE FACTS, THEY SAY THEY FEEL IT'S -- IT IS UNFAIR. JUDGE, IF WE DON'T PROVE THOSE FACTS, THEN THEY ARE ALL THE BETTER FOR IT. THEY BENEFIT FROM THAT. NOBODY IS TRYING TO SANDBAG THEM. FOR MONTHS THEY TALKED AND TRIED THIS MAN IN THE PRESS. YOU KNOW, TALK ABOUT UNCLEAN HANDS, TO VILIFY SOMEBODY LIKE THIS MAN AND EVEN TO STAND HERE TODAY, YOUR HONOR, AND REFER TO HIM AS A DREAM DEFENDANT.YOUR HONOR, WHO WOULD EVER WANT TO BE A DEFENDANT? THAT'S A -- THAT'S A -- IS IF EVER THERE WAS AN OXYMORON, YOUR HONOR, THAT MAY BE IT, ISN'T IT? A DREAM DEFENDANT? I MEAN, WHO WANTS TO BE A DEFENDANT?

THERE IS NO REPORT, WE HAVE NOT INTERVIEWED JOE STELLINI. WE DON'T HAVE UNLIMITED RESOURCES LIKE THEY HAVE, YOUR HONOR. MICHAEL BADEN. MICHAEL BADEN AND BARBARA WOLF CAME OUT HERE THE WEEK OF THESE MURDERS, IF THE COURT PLEASE.THEY WENT OVER -- AND THERE IS A LETTER WHERE MR. SHAPIRO OFFERED -- THEY OFFERED TO HELP THE LAPD AND THE CORONER'S OFFICE HELP SOLVE THIS CRIME WHICH WAS -- WHICH WAS REJECTED. THEY WENT OVER TO THE LAB. THEY WENT OVER AND LOOKED AT THESE EXHIBITS. THEY KNEW ABOUT THEM FROM THE BEGINNING, JUDGE. THEY WERE THERE LIKE JUNE 15. THEY KNOW ABOUT IT.THE ONE REPORT FROM HENRY LEE THAT YOU KNOW ABOUT, WE TURNED THAT OVER. I MEAN, WE DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER REPORTS. NOW, I MEAN, I CAN'T MAKE -- THESE ARE BUSY MEN. HENRY LEE IS THE FOREMOST BLOOD SPLATTER CRIME SCENE FORENSIC EXPERT IN THE COUNTRY.AND SO THEY MIGHT NOT LIKE WE HAVE HENRY LEE ON THE SIDE, BUT THAT'S NOT THE REASON TO BAR US. THEY KNOW ABOUT IT.

","JANUARY 26, 1995 ",10:00 A.M.
#MR. COCHRAN: ,"I WALKED OVER TO YOUR HONOR'S CLERK AND I SAID MAY I HAVE -- MAY I GET THIS ENVELOPE -- THE ENVELOPE EARLIER, AND THEN I ASKED MR. DOUGLAS TO GET IT.BEFORE I FINISHED DOING ANYTHING, I WAS OVER HERE, I WALKED OVER TO MR. HODGMAN AND I SAID LET ME MAKE AN OFFER OF PROOF TO YOU. I'M NOT GOING TO TRY TO OPEN THIS.WHAT I WAS SEEKING TO TRY TO DO -- AND YOU'LL HAVE TO MAKE THE JUDGMENT ON THIS -- I AM A TRIAL LAWYER, AND THIS IS A COURT'S EXHIBIT, SO IT'S NOT ANYTHING I HAD. I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE CHAIN OF CUSTODY.AND I MADE THE OFFER OF PROOF THERE. WHAT I WAS SEEKING TO TRY AND DO WAS USE THIS AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE PEOPLE'S RUSH TO JUDGMENT.NOW, I KNOW THEY WOULDN'T LIKE ME TO USE THOSE WORDS, JUDGE, BUT THEY CAN'T STOP ME FROM USING THOSE WORDS, AND THAT WAS ANOTHER EXAMPLE, AS I TRIED TO DEMONSTRATE WITH THE FINGERNAILS AND WITH THE OTHER THINGS THAT THEY DIDN'T BOTHER CHECKING UP ON.WHEN MR. HODGMAN SAID, WELL, I LIKE TO APPROACH THE BENCH, WE APPROACHED THE BENCH. YOU AT FIRST, AS YOU RECALL -- I WILL TELL YOU WHAT YOUDID -- YOU AT FIRST FELT IT WAS APPROPRIATE. WHEN YOU INQUIRED FURTHER AS TO WHETHER THEY HAD SOME REPORT, WHICH APPARENTLY MR. HODGMAN SAID THEY DIDN'T HAVE, WHICH I DIDN'T HAVE EITHER AND I THOUGHT THEY PROBABLY HAD IT, YOU SAID, WELL, IF THEY DON'T HAVE THAT REPORT, MR. COCHRAN, YOU CAN'T DO IT, AND WE HAVE PUT IT BACK. WE NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT.NOW, THAT GETS BLOWN ALL OUTOF PROPORTIONS AND WE STILL DON'T KNOW UNTIL -- HIS SPECULATION. HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IS IN THAT ENVELOPE. LET ME MAKE THAT CLEAR. I DON'T THINK HE KNOWS. IF HE DOES, THAT IS SOMETHING ELSE THEY KNOW THAT WE DON'T -- THEY CLAIM THEY DON'T KNOW, BUT WE HAVE NEVER SAID WHAT'S IN THAT ENVELOPE, NEVER, AND WE DIDN'T YESTERDAY AT ALL AND THE JURORS DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.SO WITH REGARD TO THIS MAN'S PHYSICAL CONDITION, HE'S OUR CLIENT. I KNOW ABOUT HIS PHYSICAL CONDITION. DOCTOR HUIZENGA IS ON THE LIST. WHEN WE GET A REPORT FROM DR. HUIZENGA OR FROM HIS RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS SPECIALIST, RHEUMATOLOGIST, I GUESS HE'S CALLED, YOUR HONOR, WE WILL BE THE FIRST TO BRING THAT FORWARD TO YOU.MR. DARDEN GETS UP HERE AND SAYS I MENTIONED DINO BUCCOLLA. I NEVER MENTIONED DINO BUCCOLLA ONE TIME. NEVER MENTIONED HIM IN OPENING STATEMENT AT ALL. YOU HAD TO POINT THAT OUT AND I NEVER DID THAT.SO LET ME JUST END MY REMARKS BY SAYING AND ASKING YOUR HONOR TO DO THE RIGHT THING WITH REGARD TO THIS.BILL HODGMAN IS SOMEBODY THAT I HAVE A GREAT AMOUNT OF RESPECT FOR, AS I HAVE INDICATED, AND I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HIS PHYSICAL CONDITION AND I HOPE THAT HE WILL GET WELL SOON AND I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AND I HAVE DISCUSSED THAT WITH OUR CLIENT.BUT TALK ABOUT SANCTIONS. WHEN HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A CASE, JUDGE, WHERE FIRST OF ALL THEY GET UP AND MAKE AN UNFETTERED OPENING STATEMENT TO OUR JURY. BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE PROFESSIONAL WE DIDN'T OBJECT UNTIL THE VERY END WHEN IT BECAME ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.BECAUSE OF EVENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL, I COULDN'T START THAT DAY. WE HAD TO LEAVE. THE JURORS GOT TO GO HOME THAT NIGHT.WE CAME BACK THE NEXT DAY AND I GOT MY CHANCE TO MAKE THE OPENING STATEMENT, IN WHICH THE THINGS THAT I SAID I EXPECT TO PROVE, THINGS THAT I KNOW FROM MY CLIENT. I DON'T THINK THAT THEY CAN CHANGE THAT OR TALK ABOUT LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD.BECAUSE APPARENTLY THEY FELT THE JOB THAT I DID MADE THEM NERVOUS AND UPSET THE NEXT DAY WESAW -- SAW THESE HISTRIONICS AND SO THEY NOW WANT YOU TO CARVE OUT SOME NEW LAW. THEY HAVE NO CASES THAT CITE THIS, AND YOU HAVE A LOT OF DISCRETION, JUDGE. THEY WANT TO CARVE OUT SOMETHING TO GIVE THEM LIKE ANOTHER OPENING SO THAT THEY CAN GET BACK UP AND TALK. WELL, THEN DO I GET A CHANCE TO RESPOND TO THAT? I MEAN, THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.EVERYTHING THAT WE DID, WE HAVE DONE IN GOOD FAITH. WE WANT TO TRY THIS CASE AS MUCH AS THEY DO. AND IN FACT YOU RECALL I HAVE SAID FOR THE LAST TEN DAYS, LET'S STOP ALL THIS POSTURING AND LET'S GET THIS CASE ON THE WAY.THE FINAL THING I WANT TO SAY IS THIS:THAT IT IS RARELY PRODUCTIVE OF GOOD TO MALIGN CITIZENS. AS YOU KNOW, I'M -- I AM A BIG FIGHTER FOR JURORS AND FOR WITNESSES. AND FOR MR. DARDEN TO STAND HERE AND SAY THAT CHRISTIAN RIECHARDT -- REINHART -- RIECHARDT, RATHER, WAS DUMPED BY FAYE RESNICK IS PERHAPS THE GREATEST BIT OF HYPERBOLE I HAVE EVER HEARD. THAT IS SO FAR FROM THE TRUTH. IT STRAINS CREDULITY. IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. HE PUT HER OUT BECAUSE SHE WAS USING DRUGS AND AFTER SHE USED DRUGS SO BADLY, AND IN THAT FIVE OR SIX-DAY PERIOD, HE WAS THE ONE WHO HELP PUT HER IN A DRUG TREATMENT PLACE.

THEY HAVE ASKED ME TO TELL THE JURY THAT I'M STRIKING FROM YOUR COMMENTS AND FOR THEM TO IGNORE YOUR REFERENCES TO THESE VARIOUS WITNESSES AND ITEMS THAT THEY HAVE DISCUSSED. THEY HAVE ASKED ME TO ADMONISH THEM THAT THE MENTION OF THOSE WAS NOT APPROPRIATE BECAUSE THE PROSECUTION WAS ENTITLED TO KNOW OF THOSE WITNESS STATEMENTS OR THE IDENTITY OF THOSE WITNESSES BEFORE THE OPENING STATEMENT WAS MADE, AND THEY ARE ASKING FOR A THIRTY-DAY CONTINUANCE.SO I WOULD LIKE YOUR OBSERVATIONS ON THE VARIOUS SANCTIONS THAT THE PROSECUTION HAS REQUESTED.

AND THE ONLY REASON I WAS TALKING ABOUT RIECHARDT, I JUST FELT YOU HAVE -- YOU HAVE TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT SOMETIME.THERE IS A MAN -- HE IS A DOCTOR, JUDGE. HE IS OUT THERE HAVING THE SLINGS AND ARROWS -- WE CAN TAKE IT, BUT IT IS NOT FAIR TO THESE OTHER PEOPLE TO GO THROUGH CHRISTOPHER DARDEN'S -- I KNOW HE LOVES THEM, TOO, BUT WE CAN TAKE IT BETTER.JUDGE, WITH REGARD YOUR -- TO THE THIRTY DAYS, I THINK AGAIN, YOUR HONOR, IT IS ALMOST LIKE THEY ARE KIDDING ABOUT THIRTY DAYS. YOUR HONOR, WE WERE AT THE -- THEY HAVEN'T EVEN CALLED THEIR FIRST WITNESS.YOU KNOW, YOU ARE VERY OPTIMISTIC AND SO AM I GENERALLY. I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THE DEFENSE IS GOING TO START WITHIN TWO MONTHS, PROBABLY MORE LIKE THREE MONTHS. JUDGE, BY THAT TIME THEY WILL HAVE TIME TO INVESTIGATE EVERYTHING. THEY'VE GOT THE LAPD, THEY'VE GOT THE D.A.'S OFFICE, THEY'VE GOT EVERYTHING.THEY GOT ALL THIS INFORMATION THEY SUPPOSEDLY GOT ON MARY ANNE GERCHAS, SUPPOSEDLY, WHICH APPARENTLY ISN'T TRUE, AND THEY CAN HAVE ALL THE TIME THEY WANT TO INVESTIGATE IT, AND AS MR. DOUGLAS SAYS, WE ARE NOT TRYING TO PLAYING ANY GAMES, AND TO SHOW THAT, THEY CAN HAVE AS MUCH TIME AS THEY WANT. I DON'T MIND IF WE CAN CALL HER AS A WITNESS, CALLING HER WHATEVER TIME YOU SAY. PLAY BY THE RULES. I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM. WE MADE A MISTAKE WITH REGARD TO HER.WITH REGARD TO THE OTHER WITNESSES, JUDGE, THEY'RE -- THEY'RE -- I DON'T THINK THEY CAN SHOW THERE WERE ANY MISTAKES. I THINK THAT THEY KNEW ABOUT KARY MULLIS. THEY KNEW -- I MEAN, THEY SAY TO ME THAT I SAY THAT HE HAS, UMM -- THAT THIS MAN SUFFERS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. THOSE ARE THE FACTS AND I WILL BE ABLE TO PROVE THAT.WHAT DO WE STRIKE BASED ON THAN THAT? THEY DON'T LIKE THE TRUTH AND THEY WANT TO TRY TO CHANGE IT AROUND. TALKING ABOUT A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD, SO AS I LISTEN TO IT, I DIDN'T SEE -- AND I TRIED TO GO THROUGH THE LIST OF WITNESSES, UMM -- UMM, I MENTIONED RON FISCHMAN AND THEY KNEW -- THEY KNOW ABOUT RON FISCHMAN. WE HADN'T TURNED THAT REPORT OVER.THEY -- WE -- CHRIS RIECHARDT, THEY KNEW ABOUT CHRIS RIECHARDT, JUDGE, BECAUSE THEY'VE INTERVIEWED HIM. THEY'VE INTERVIEWED HIM. WE DON'T HAVE A REPORT, I DON'T THINK, FROM CHRISTIAN RIECHARDT. WE DON'T HAVE A REPORT. AND WE DON'T HAVE A REPORT FROM FISCHMAN SO WE HAVE NOTHING TO TURN OVER.THEY KNOW ABOUT LENORE WALKER, JUDGE. IN FACT, LET ME RESPOND TO THAT ON LENORE WALKER. WITH REGARD TO LENORE WALKER, WE GOT A SPECIAL ORDER, SHE WENT TO THE JAIL OVER TWO WEEKENDS. SHE HAS NOT FINISHED HER EXAMINATION, AS I INDICATED TO THE JURORS. WE DON'T HAVE A REPORT FROM HER AND WE DON'T HAVE ONE EITHER FROM GERALDINE BUTTS STAHLY EITHER WHO IS HER ASSOCIATE BECAUSE THEY WERE DUE TO GO TO THE JAIL LAST WEEKEND TO FINISH THEIRS REPORTS. THEY HAVEN'T FINISHED THEM, OR FINISHED THE TESTING.SO AGAIN, THAT'S NOT ANYTHING. WE TRIED TO GIVE THEM THE CV AND WE HAVE DONE WHAT WE COULD ON THAT.WITH REGARD TO MICHELLE ABUDRAHM, THEY KNEW ABOUT MICHELLE ABUDRAHM.JOE STELLINI THERE IS NO REPORT.SO JUDGE, THE SANCTIONS THEY ARE ASKING ARE FAR OUT OF LINE WITH WHAT -- WHAT SHOULD TAKE PLACE. I THINK WE ARE IN A SIMILAR POSITION THAN WHAT THEY WERE.AND WHAT I AM TRYING TO INDICATE TO YOU THAT WE HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING INTENTIONALLY, WE WOULD NOT DO THAT. WE ARE JUST TRYING TO GET WHAT WE KNOW WE CAN PROVE BEFORE THIS JURY AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE TIME AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE HAD TO DO THAT.AND SO I WOULD ASK THE COURT NOT TO TRY TO COME BACK AND THEN GUT MY OPENING STATEMENT BY TRYING TO PICK OUT THINGS THAT WE SAID. IT IS THE SAME SITUATION. IF WE DON'T PROVE THOSE THINGS, THE PROBLEM COMES WITH THAT.WHERE DOES IT SAY THAT BECAUSE IN AN OPENING STATEMENT I MAKE A STATEMENT BELIEVING THAT THEY HAVE MARY ANNE GERCHAS' TESTIMONY AND THEY DON'T HAVE IT, WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE, BECAUSE OF -- OF THE STATEMENT OF ITSELF, IN THAT STATEMENT IF YOU LOOK AT IT, HAS THE D.A.'S PHONE NUMBER. MARY ANNE GERCHAS SAYS SHE HAS THE D.A.'S PHONE NUMBER FROM PATTY FAIRBANKS WHO SHE PUTS ON HOLD AND SHE ELLS ABOUT CALLING THE THESE POLICE DEPARTMENTS.AND THIS IS AN INVESTIGATOR I NEVER MET IT AND I RECEIVED THAT REPORT WITHIN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE THE ARGUMENT.SO I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT IT, WHAT I THINK YOU SHOULD DO IS PUT IS IN THE SAME POSITION THAT YOU PUT THE PROSECUTION IN WHEN THEY WERE FACED WITH THIS SAME SITUATION IN DECEMBER AND WHAT'S IS FAIR FOR THEM IS FAIR FOR US. WE WOULDN'T ASK ANY MORE OR ANY LESS.IT DOESN'T GO TO MY OPENING STATEMENT. JUDGE, MUCH OF WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN OVER THE LAST COUPLE DAYS, MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT, IS TO TRY TO KEEP ME FROM GETTING BACK UP BEFORE THAT JURY.THERE IS AN ULTIMATE SANCTION TODAY. NOW, I BELIEVE THAT BILL HODGMAN IS SICK, BUT EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED WHEN MR. HODGMAN -- WHEN MR. DARDEN KEPT TALKING AND SAYING THE SAME THING SIX OR SEVEN TIMES, I THOUGH HE WAS FILIBUSTERING AND OBVIOUSLY IT WAS SO I COULDN'T TALK TO THIS JURY TODAY.BUT ULTIMATELY, JUDGE, NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO, I GET TO FINISH TALKING TO THIS JURY. THAT IS NOT A SANCTION THEY CAN IMPOSE. I GET TO GET BACK UP THERE AND THEY ARE NOT GOING TO LIKE THAT, SO THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT, SO I ASK YOU TO BE FAIR IN THAT AND BE FAIR LIKE I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN POSING TO THEM.IF WE SLIPPED UP TELLING YOU, IT WAS NOT INTENTIONAL. WE WOULD NOT DO THAT. AND IF WE SLIPPED UP, THE SAME SANCTIONS THEY GOT IN DECEMBER SHOULD PERTAIN TO US, AND IF THAT HAPPENS, IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE OPENING STATEMENT. I HAVEN'T MISLED ANYBODY.IF CHRISTIAN RIECHARDT --
","JANUARY 26, 1995 ",10:00 A.M.
#THE COURT: ,"WELL, THE PROBLEM IS I CAN'T REALLY IMPOSE THE SAME SANCTION AT THIS POINT BECAUSE PART OF THE SANCTION WAS I TOLD THEM THEY COULD NOT USE CERTAIN WITNESSES IN THEIR CASE IN CHIEF UNTIL THEY HAD COMPLETED THEIR ORIGINAL WITNESS LIST AND THEY COULD NOT MENTION IT IN OPENING STATEMENT, WHICH AS FAR AS MR. DARDEN IS CONCERNED, I ESSENTIALLY TOOK THE HEART OUT OF HIS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ARGUMENT BECAUSE HE WAS NOT ABLE TO MENTION THREE OR FOUR OTHER INCIDENTS THAT FILL IN CERTAIN TIME GAPS.I ASSUME THAT'S THE ARGUMENT HE IS ABOUT TO JUMP UP AND MAKE.

I THINK -- FOR INSTANCE, CHRISTIAN RIECHARDT, THEY ALREADY KNOW ABOUT IT. WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A REPORT. THAT IS MAYBE A BAD EXAMPLE. THEY KNOW ABOUT HIM, THEY ALREADY HAVE A REPORT AND MAYBE THAT'S A BAD EXAMPLE.THE ONLY ONE THAT I CAN REALLY FIX ON, BECAUSE THEY KNOW ABOUT RON FISCHMAN, IS MAYBE MARY ANNE GERCHAS AND I'M JUST SAYING TO YOUR HONOR THAT IN 24 HOURS THEY'VE DONE ALL THIS WORK SUPPOSEDLY ON HER. THE REST OF THE PEOPLE, JUDGE, THEY KNEW ABOUT AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY REPORTS ON THEM, SO I DON'T KNOW WHERE -- WHERE WE GO FROM THERE TO SAYING -- ADMONISHING THIS JURY REGARDING THIS.YOU ADMONISHED THEM. EVEN AFTER I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO TALK TO THEM FOR A WHOLE EVENING, WHEN THEY CAME IN YESTERDAY YOU STARTED OFF BY SAYING ""WHAT COUNSEL SAYS IS NOT EVIDENCE"" AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IT IS; IT IS NOT EVIDENCE.SO YOU KNOW, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE EVIDENCE. THE CASE WILL ULTIMATELY BE -- WHY ARE THEY SO AFRAID? THE CASE WILL ULTIMATELY BE DECIDED. WE WANT TO UPHOLD ALL THE RULES LIKE EVERYONE ELSE, BUT WHY ARE THEY SO WORRIED ABOUT THAT, JUDGE? ULTIMATELY IT IS GOING TO BE THE EVIDENCE THAT THIS CASE IS DECIDED UPON AND THAT IS ALL THAT I WANTED US TO GET BACK TO.THE REST OF THESE WITNESSES, IN SUMMARY, THEN IS THAT THEY KNEW ABOUT THEM, WE DON'T HAVE ANY REPORTS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MARY ANNE GERCHAS, THAT I CAN SEE AS I LOOK AT THE LIST, AND I THINK THAT THE SANCTIONS ARE WAY OUT OF LINE WITH WHERE WE ARE AND HAVING UNDERSTOOD WHAT YOUR SANCTIONS WERE BACK THEN, BUT TO DEAL WITH WHERE WE ARE AT THIS POINT.WITH REGARD TO MARY ANNE GERCHAS, THIS IS A WITNESS THAT GAVE A STATEMENT. I DON'T KNOW HER. I HAVE A STATEMENT FROM HER. THE INVESTIGATORS TALKED TO HER AND THAT'S HOW IT CAME TO ME. I ASSUME THEY HAD IT AND I WASN'T AWARE THEY DIDN'T, AND AGAIN, I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S ANY REASON THAT MR. SIMPSON SHOULD HAVE TO SUFFER OR THESE JURORS WOULD HAVE TO BE TOLD, OH, GEE, IT'S NOT EVIDENCE, BUT JUST DISREGARD THAT, IT IS NOT EVIDENCE, AND YOU KNOW -- JUDGE, IF WE DO IT BASED UPON THAT, I COULD COME BACK TOMORROW AND SAY TO YOU, JUDGE, I WANT YOU -- I WANT TO LOOK AT THE TRANSCRIPT FOR ALL THE TIMES MISS CLARK WAS ARGUMENTATIVE THAT I DIDN'T OBJECT, BECAUSE AS AN OFFICER OF THIS COURT AND A GENTLEMAN I DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT.THAT IS LIKE RUNNING BACK -- DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT, I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. I WANT TO GET THIS TRIAL ON. I WANT TO FINISH MY OPENING STATEMENT SO THAT THEY CAN CALL THEIR FIRST WITNESSES.AND SO WHAT I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO DO IS FASHION SOMETHING THAT IS REASONABLE. YOU ARE WISE AND THESE SITUATIONS IT CALLS FOR A WISE DECISION.WHERE WE HAVE DONE SOMETHING IN GOOD FAITH, AND I WILL CONCLUDE BY SAYING THIS, JUDGE, WHAT I CERTAINLY DON'T REFER TO OURSELVES AS THE DREAM TEAM, JUST A COLLECTION OF LAWYERS WHO ARE TRYING TO DO THE BEST WE CAN FOR OUR CLIENT, AND THAT IS ALL WE ARE DOING.AND MR. DARDEN CAN REFER TO THIS DERISIVELY OR ANYWAY HE WANTS TO, BUT WE'RE JUST TRYING TO DO OUR JOB AND IN THAT, JUDGE, WE ARE TRYING TO REPRESENT OUR CLIENT TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY AND I THINK YOU KNOW WE WOULD NEVER INTENTIONALLY MISLEAD THIS COURT. WE WOULD NOT DO THAT. I WOULD NOT DO THAT. I KNOW MY REPUTATION MEANS FAR TOO MUCH TO ME AND THIS CASE IS NOT THE LAST CASE OF MY CAREER AND SO WE DON'T HAVE THE OBSESSION THAT SOME SEEM TO HAVE ABOUT THIS CASE.WE WANT TO TRY THIS CASE. WE THINK WE ARE GOING TO WIN THIS CASE, BUT WE ARE NOT OUT HERE TRYING TO WIN THIS CASE AT ALL COSTS. WE ARE TRYING TO DO IT METHODICALLY AND DO THE JOB THAT WE ARE PAID TO DO, AND THAT'S WHAT WE EXPECT TO DO, ETHICALLY AND MORALLY, YOUR HONOR.AND ALL I ASK YOU TO DO IS TO ALLOW US -- REMEMBER THAT PART OF THE SANCTIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN THE DELAYS, THE INTERMINABLE DELAYS IN MY OPENING STATEMENT IN GETTING BACK TO THAT JURY. ALLOW ME TO GET BACK TO THAT JURY WITHOUT ANY REAL UNNECESSARY DELAY.IF THE COURT FELT THAT THERE WAS SOME PROBLEM WITH REGARD TO BILL HODGMAN, OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO LISTEN TO THAT. I MEAN, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I AM SENSITIVE TO AND I HAVE TALKED TO MR. SIMPSON ABOUT THAT. HE WANTS TO PROCEED AS FAST AS HE CAN. I'M SENSITIVE TO THAT.BUT WITH REGARD TO THESE OTHER THINGS, JUDGE, IF YOU LOOK AT IT WHEN IT IS REDUCED DOWN, YOU KNOW THINGS THAT I KNEW BECAUSE MY CLIENT TOLD ME, I DON'T HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO DO THAT, AND I HOPE I PUT THE ENVELOPE AND THE ANOTHER THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE, SO I WOULD ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THAT YOUR HONOR HAS FOR ME AT THIS POINT.

HE WAS ON THE KELLY-FRYE LIST AND HIS DELETION IN THE TRIAL LIST LED US TO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS NOT GOING TO BE CALLED AT TRIAL AND THAT IS THE PROBLEM THAT IS POSED, IS THAT WE WERE JUST BEGINNING TO PREPARE FOR THE KELLY-FRYE AND THEN MATTERS WERE TRANSPIRING AT A RAPID PACE.WE CEASED PREPARATION WHEN IT APPEARED THAT THERE WAS NOT GOING TO BE A KELLY-FRYE HEARING AND THAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH HIM, BUT IT IS NOT NEARLY AS EGREGIOUS AS THE OTHERS BECAUSE WE DID HAVE SOME NOTICE OF HIS EXISTENCE FOR THE DEFENSE.LET ME INDICATE TO THE COURT THAT WITH RESPECT TO THE THIRTY DAYS, I BELIEVE IT WAS THE DEFENSE WHO INDICATED AT THE COURT'S REQUEST PRIOR TO THIS WHEN THEY WANTED TIME TO INVESTIGATE WITNESSES THAT THEY CLAIMED THEY WERE GIVEN LATE NOTICE OF, ALTHOUGH THEY GOT THEM FAR IN ADVANCE OF THE LAST HOUR OF OPENING STATEMENT, THEY ASKED FOR SIX WEEKS. THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS A REASONABLE TIME FOR INVESTIGATION, AS DID THE COURT.WE ARE ASKING FOR LESS, EVEN THOUGH WE WOULD BE, UNDER A PARITY OF REASONING, ENTITLED TO THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME FOR REASONABLE INVESTIGATION.WE ARE NOT OBSESSED WITH THIS CASE, YOUR HONOR, BUT I WONDER ABOUT THE DEFENSE OBSESSION BECAUSE THEIR DESPERATE TACTICS IN THROWING ETHICS OUT THE WINDOW AND BEHAVING AS THEY HAVE IS EVIDENCE OF CLEARLY THE OPPOSITE OF WANTING THE FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE THAT WE ARE ENTITLED TO IN THIS CASE.THERE SHOULD BE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. THIS CONDUCT SHOULD NOT BE MINIMIZED THIS WAY.MR. COCHRAN IS VERY PERSUASIVE, VERY TALENTED, VERY CHARISMATIC, BUT I'M SORRY,YOUR HONOR, IN THIS CASE HE IS WRONG. HE HAS DONE WRONG. THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO BEHAVE. THIS IS NOT ETHICAL CONDUCT OR BEHAVIOR.AND AS I TOLD THE COURT, HE GLIBLY STANDS UP TO SAY, WELL, THE PEOPLE CAN ADDRESS IT ALL IN CLOSING ARGUMENT. NO, NO. SEE, IT'S TOO LATE, BECAUSE BY THEN, YOUR HONOR, THERE WILL HAVE BEEN MONTHS OF TIME FOR WHATEVER THAT JURY HAS PICKED UP THAT WILL NEVER BE ADDRESSED IN TRIAL.THOSE WITNESSES THAT MR. COCHRAN REFERRED TO THAT MAY NEVER BE CALLED OUT OF SOME KIND OF FEAR THAT HE'S THINKING OF OR WITNESSES THAT NEVER APPEAR AT ALL, THAT AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN REPRESENTED IN FRONT OF THIS JURY, THEY WILL HAVE THAT WITNESS IN THE BACK OF THEIR MIND AND THAT MAY BE ENOUGH TO PERSUADE THE ONE.ANY KIND OF RELIEF THAT THE COURT GRANTS US AT THIS POINT MAY STILL NOT BE ENOUGH, BECAUSE THE DAMAGE MAY BE INDELIBLE AT THIS POINT AFTER HAVING MENTIONED ALL THESE PEOPLE THAT HE HIMSELF KNOWS HE IS IN DANGER OF NOT ULTIMATELY BEING CALLED BECAUSE ONCE THEY ARE INVESTIGATED IT IS DETERMINED THEY HAVE RECORDS, THEY HAVE FELONY RECORDS.THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT REALLY WILL NOT WITHSTAND THE SCRUTINY, THEY KNOW IT. THE DEFENSE KNOWS IT. AND THE WILFULNESS OF THEIR TACTIC IN DELAYING THE DISCOVERY IS SHOWN BY VIRTUE OF ONE SIMPLE FACT.EARLY ON IN THESE PROCEEDINGS THE DEFENDANT THROWS UP THE NAME OF FRANK CHIUCHIOLO FROM HAPPY CAMP. THIS WAS A MAN WHO CAME FORWARD TO SAY HE SAW TWO WHITE BURGLARS LEAVING THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN. IT WAS THEN DISCOVERED THAT HE HAD COME FORWARD TO OFFER FALSE INFORMATION ON OTHER FAMOUS CASES AND HIS CREDIBILITY WAS EXPLODED, AS IT DESERVED TO BE.AND THE DEFENSE REALIZED THAT THEN THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO SHIELD, HIDE THEIR WITNESSES TO PREVENT THE EXPOSURE THAT WOULD SHOW THEM TO BE AS INCREDIBLE AS THEY ARE, AND THAT IS WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IN THIS CASE, SO IT IS A VERY WILLFUL THING, AND IT IS NOT A MINOR THING.THIS IS A MAJOR FORM OF MISCONDUCT THAT HAS OCCURRED AND I DON'T WANT MR. COCHRAN TO MINIMIZE IT THIS WAY. IT IS MAJOR. AND IF WE LACK -- LET ME JUST CONTRAST IT FOR A MOMENT, BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT THE COURT IS GOING TO SAY, OKAY?THEIR STATEMENTS WERE TAKEN FOUR, FIVE --

#THE COURT: ,"HOW AM I GOING TO RULE?
","JANUARY 26, 1995 ",10:00 A.M.

","JANUARY 26, 1995 ",10:00 A.M.
#THE COURT: ,"NEVER MIND.
","JANUARY 26, 1995 ",10:00 A.M.
#MS. CLARK: ,"COUNSEL WANTS TO COMPARE THE GRAVITY OF THEIR MISCONDUCT TO WHAT OCCURRED WITH THE PEOPLE, AND LET ME CONTRAST THE TWO.THE STATEMENT TURNED OVER BY THE PEOPLE WERE TWO AND THREE WEEKS LATE. THE STATEMENTS TURNED OVER BY THE DEFENSE WERE FOUR, FIVE AND EVEN SEVEN MONTHS LATE.WE WERE SANCTIONED FOR THAT FOR JUST TWO OR THREE WEEKS AND NOW THEY ARE FIGHTING THE SANCTION FOR FOUR, FIVE, EVEN SEVEN MONTHS FOR MATERIAL WITNESSES, OBVIOUSLY WITNESSES THEY THINK ARE VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE MR. COCHRAN IS OUTLINING THEIR TESTIMONY TO THE JURY.AND WHEN YOU ALSO LOOK AT IT IN THIS CONTEXT, YOUR HONOR, OUT OF THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PAGES THAT WE HAVE TURNED OVER, DOZENS OF VIDEOTAPES, DOZENS OF AUDIOTAPES, WE HAVE -- WE WERE SLOW TO TURN OVER -- BY THAT I MEAN TWO TO THREE WEEKS, A FEW PAGES OF DISCOVERY, COMPARED TO WHAT THEY DID.WE HAD SEVENTY PAGES OF DISCOVERY, YOUR HONOR, UNTIL THE LAST TWO OR THREE DAYS.NOW, THEY HAVE DOUBLED THE AMOUNT OF DISCOVERY IN THE LAST TWO OR THREE DAYS. WHAT THAT SHOWS THIS COURT IS NOT ONLY THAT THE GRAVITY IS VERY SEVERE, THAT THE MISCONDUCT IS VERY SERIOUS, BUT THAT IT IS NOT INADVERTENT AND CANNOT BE CLAIMED TO BE.YOU DON'T OVERLOOK OVER HALF YOUR CASE AND THAT IS WHAT THEY CLAIM TO BE DOABLE. I DON'T BELIEVE IT. I DON'T BELIEVE IT.MR. COCHRAN IS AN EXCELLENT LAWYER. HE KNOWS WHAT THEY INTEND TO USE. HE KNOWS WHAT HE INTENDS TO TELL THIS JURY. HIS STATEMENT WAS TYPED AND IT WAS PREPARED, AND HE CANNOT COME BEFORE THE COURT AND TELL US THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THESE WITNESSES BEFORE OR WAS UNAWARE OF THEIR STATEMENTS.AND THE FACT THAT MR. JONES -- EXCUSE ME -- MR. DOUGLAS CAN STAND UP BEFORE THIS COURT AND SAY -- AND TRY TO EXCUSE THE MISCONDUCT BY SAYING, WELL, THIS WASN'T ALWAYS THE LAW, THAT MAKES IT EVEN MORE EGREGIOUS, BECAUSE WHAT HE IS INDICATING IS A DESIRE TO THWART THE LAW, A DESIRE BASED UPON HIS OWN BELIEF AS TO WHAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO AS DEFENSE COUNSEL.UNFORTUNATELY THE VOTERS OF THIS STATE HAVE SPOKEN. THEY SAY WE WILL NOT COUNTENANCE ANY MORE OF THIS HIDE THE BALL STUFF, THIS SHELL GAME DURING THE COURSE OF A CRIMINAL TRIAL. WE WANT BOTH SIDES TO AIR THEIR WITNESSES SO EVERYBODY CAN HAVE FULL AND COMPLETE INVESTIGATION, AND THAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH WHAT DEFENSE COUNSEL HAS DONE. THEY ARE TRYING TO PREVENT US FROM DOING OUR JOB.I WANT MR. COCHRAN TO GET UP TO SPEAK TO THIS JURY AS LONG AS HE WANTS TO. I DON'T WANT TO STOP HIM FROM TALKING. I WANT THIS OPENING STATEMENT TO GET GOING AND TO GET COMPLETED. I WANT HIM TO BE ABLE TO PUT ON EVERY WITNESS HE DESIRES.ALL I ASK IS THE ABILITY FOR THE PEOPLE TO INVESTIGATE THESE WITNESSES SO THAT THE JURY GETS THE WHOLE TRUTH, SO THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW THE JURY WHO THESE PEOPLE REALLY ARE, AND WHEN THESE PEOPLE ARE HIDDEN FROM OUR INVESTIGATORS, WE CANNOT LET THE JURY DOES NOT GET THE TRUE PICTURE WHO HAVE THEY REALLY ARE.I WOULD NOT BE DOING MY JOB IF DEFENSE COUNSEL WERE PERMITTED TO TROT A PARADE OF WITNESS UP TO THAT WITNESS STAND, AND WERE I TO SIT BACK AND SAY WHAT IS YOUR NAME, WHAT TIME IS IT TODAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, I SHOULD BE FIRED FOR THAT.IT IS OUR JOB TO SEARCH FOR THE TRUTH AND IT IS OUR JOB TO SHOW THIS JURY THE REAL CREDIBILITY OF WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE, WHAT THESE WITNESSES REALLY ARE, AND IF THIS JURY DOESN'T GET TO SEE THAT THEY ARE DEPRIVED OF THE TRUTH, AND IF THEY ARE DEPRIVED OF THE TRUTH THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE ARE DEPRIVED OF JUSTICE, AND I CANNOT ALLOW THAT.THAT IS NOT MY JOB. MY JOB AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLE IS TO SEE THAT THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN, THAT ANY WITNESS WHO IS CALLED IS GIVEN THOROUGH AND COMPLETE EXAMINATION.AND WHAT THEY ARE ATTEMPTING TO DO HERE IS PREVENT MARY ANNE GERCHAS -- WHO NOW CLAIMS THAT SHE CALLED OUR OFFICE -- THIS IS NOT A WOMAN WHOSE CREDIBILITY IS UNSULLIED, AND IF SHE DID CALL THE OFFICE, WHICH COUNSEL KNOWS BECAUSE COUNSEL HAD THE SAME PROBLEM, WE HAVE ALL GOTTEN THOUSANDS OF CALLS FROM EVERY TOM, DICK AND HARRY THAT WANTS TO GET INVOLVED IN THIS CASE.IF THE PERSON DOESN'T PURSUE IT, SOMETIMES THEY DON'T GET REACHED AGAIN, BUT I THINK IT IS VERY INTERESTING THAT THEY SAY THAT. ARE WE SUPPOSED TO NOW SAY THAT THE LAWYERS CAN RELY ON THE WITNESSES TO GIVE DISCOVERY? IS SHE SUPPOSED TO GIVE HER DISCOVERY TO US? SOMEHOW HE IS PUTTING THE OBLIGATION ON HER TO COME FORWARD.NO, THE OBLIGATION IS NOT ON THE WITNESS TO TURN THEIR STATEMENTS IN. THE OBLIGATION IS NOT ON THE D.A.'S OFFICE TO GO BEGGING FOR THE DEFENSE WITNESSES TO COME AND TALK TO US. THE OBLIGATION IS FOR THE DEFENSE TO GIVE US WHAT THEY'VE GOT, THE SAME AS IT IS FOR TO US GIVE THEM WHAT WE HAVE GOT.AND WE HAVE DONE SO DILIGENTLY AT EVERY BEND AND TURN. WE HAVE NOT ATTEMPTED TO AVOID IT IN ANY WAY.NOW, I THINK THAT WHAT THE COURT SHOULD KNOW IS THAT MR. DOUGLAS' POSITION VIS-A-VIS THE LAW, VIS-A-VIS HIS REQUIREMENTS IN TERMS OF TURNING OVER DISCOVERY, TAKING REPORTS AND REDUCING STATEMENTS TO WRITING IS WRONG, A HUNDRED PERCENT WRONG. IT IS SO WRONG THAT PREVIOUS COURTS HAVE FOUND THAT CONDUCT TO BE CONTEMPTUOUS.I CITE THE COURT TO THE CASE OF IN RE SERRA, S-E-R-R-A, 484 FED.2D 948. THE COURT HELD THAT A DEFENSE ATTORNEY SHOULD BE HELD IN CONTEMPT FOR ASKING AN EXPERT TO REFRAIN FROM WRITING A REPORT IN ORDER TO AVOID DISCOVERY.ALSO CITE THE COURT TO SANDEFFER VERSUS SUPERIOR COURT, 18 CAL.APP. 4TH 672. IT CAUTIONED AGAIN THE ATTORNEY NOT TO DIRECT AN EXPERT TO AVOID WRITING A REPORT IN ORDER TO AVOID DISCOVERY.COUNSEL HAS DELIBERATELY DONE AN END RUN AROUND THE DISCOVERY LAWS BASICALLY BY TRYING TO GET THEIR DISCOVERY FROM THE MOUTH OF THEIR CLIENT. HERE, MR. SIMPSON, GO CALL RON FISCHMAN. TELL US WHAT HE SAID, AND THEN THEY GO AND ASK MR. SIMPSON.I MEAN, THAT IS A VERY CLEAR GAME, BUT IT CERTAINLY DOES NOT SERVE THE ENDS OF JUSTICE AND IT DOES NOT COMPORT WITH THE SPIRIT AND THE LETTER OF THE LAW UNDER 1054.WE LOVE THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE HENRY LEE FOR AN EXPERT, BUT IF HE IS SUCH A GREAT EXPERT, HE IS SO WELL RENOWN, AND I UNDERSTAND HE IS, HOW COULD HE NOT -- HOW COULD HE NOT HAVE WRITTEN A REPORT WITH RESPECT TO ALL OF THE WORK THAT COUNSEL HAS TOLD US HE HAS PERFORMED IN THIS CASE AND WILL TESTIFY TO HERE? NO REPORT. HE HAS BEEN ON THE CASE SINCE DAY ONE, WE ARE ALL AWARE OF THAT, AND TO TELL US NOW THAT HE HAS NO REPORT TO OFFER US, THAT DR. BADEN HAS NO REPORT TO OFFER US, THAT SYLVIA WOLF HAS NO REPORT TO OFFER US, THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.YOU KNOW, THIS CONDUCTING NOT BE MINIMIZED, SHOULD NOT BE MINIMIZED. WE HAVE -- WE HAVE BEEN PLACED IN A VERY -- IT IS A VERY UNFAIR POSITION THAT WE ARE PLACED IN.I THINK THAT THE GOAL OF A TRIAL IS FOR THE TRUTH TO EMERGE AND IT IS NOT FOR A LAWYER TO HOLD IN HIS HEAD INFORMATION THAT HE OR SHE MAY USE TO AMBUSH THE CASE WITH, AND THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE HERE. IT IS A TRIAL BY AMBUSH. THAT IS THE STRATEGY.THE PEOPLE WOULD REQUEST, NO. 1, THAT THE COURT ADMONISH THE JURY WITH RESPECT TO COUNSEL'S MISCONDUCT, AS I HAVE INDICATED EARLIER.NO. 2, IF THE COURT IS NOT INCLINED TO STRIKE THE COMMENTS, THE OFFENSIVE COMMENTS BY MR. COCHRAN -- AND LET ME INDICATE ABOUT THAT ENVELOPE, HE WAVED IT IN FRONT OF THAT JURY AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM SAW IT, AND WE ALL KNOW, WE ALL KNOW THAT AFTER THE PRELIMINARY HEARING WHAT OCCURRED THERE. EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT THE ENVELOPE. EVERYONE ON THE JURY SAID SO.MR. COCHRAN KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING. THAT JURY SAW WHAT HE WAS DOING AND THAT WAS A SET-UP, AS SURE AS I'M STANDING HERE, BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT HE WAS GOING TO SURPRISE US WITH THAT, A SURPRISE TACTIC THAT WE WOULD OBJECT TO AND THAT THE JURY WOULD THEN SEE THE OBJECTION AND MAYBE CONCLUDE THAT WE WERE TRYING TO HIDE EVIDENCE WHEN IN FACT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS WE HAVE BEEN HIDDEN FROM.WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IS IN THE ENVELOPE. WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE REPORT. COUNSEL KNOWS BETTER THAN WE DO. THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE WAVING AROUND. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW.ALL WE ARE ASKING IS LET US KNOW. WE WANT TO KNOW. WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT THEIR WITNESSES HAVE TO SAY. WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE EVIDENCE IS. IS THAT ASKING SO MUCH? UNDER 1054 IT IS NOT ASKING ANYTHING THAT WE ARE NOT ENTITLED TO. THAT IS ALL WE ASK FOR. AND UNDER 1054 THERE ARE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF SANCTIONS THAT ARE ALLOWED UNDER THE LAW, AND MR. COCHRAN IS AWARE OF THAT.AND IF THE COURT IS NOT INCLINED TO STRIKE THE OFFENSIVE COMMENTS, THEN THE PEOPLE WOULD REQUEST THAT WE BE ALLOWED TO REOPEN TO ADDRESS THOSE MATTERS, BUT THAT IS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ADMONITION, AND THAT AFTER THE CONCLUSION OF OPENING STATEMENT THAT WE BE PERMITTED TO A CONTINUANCE IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE ALL OF THESE WITNESS THAT WERE JUST RECENTLY THROWN AT US AT THE CONCLUSION OF MR. COCHRAN'S OPENING STATEMENT REMARKS YESTERDAY.I THINK IT IS ONLY -- THE ALTERNATIVES THAT I HAVE POSED TO THE COURT I THINK ARE THE ONLY WAY THAT THE PEOPLE CAN BE MADE WHOLE. WE ARE NOT BEING HYSTERICAL HERE. WE ARE SIMPLY ASKING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO OUR JOB. THAT IS ALL WE ARE ASKING.

WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT THAT TOGETHER IN A FORM THAT WILL ALLOW ME TO SUCCINCTLY STATE FOR THE COURT WHAT THE POINTS ARE THAT WE INTEND TO ADDRESS WITH EACH WITNESS.I WOULD SIMPLY INDICATE THAT THE STATEMENT TAKEN FROM MARY ANNE GERCHAS MOST RECENTLY REFLECTS THE FACT THAT COUNSEL, COUNSEL ALONE WAS IN POSSESSION OF HER STATEMENT, THAT SHE ASKED COUNSEL TO TURN HER STATEMENT OVER TO THE PROSECUTION AND COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENSE NEVER DID.SHE INDICATES VERY SPECIFICALLY THAT SHE SPOKE TO MR.

THAT ASSERTION THAT THEY HAVE NOT EVEN EXAMINED THE EVIDENCE IS INCREDIBLE TO ME.IF THAT IS THE CASE, AND HE'S MADE REPRESENTATIONS AS TO WHAT THEIR FINDINGS ARE, I THINK THAT THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF CREDIBILITY LOST WITH RESPECT TO THOSE WITNESSES.

IT WAS STATED IN THE LOS ANGELES TIMES BY DR. LENORE WALKER HERSELF THAT SHE WAS RETAINED BY COUNSEL IN THE SUMMER OF '94 AND THAT SHE HAS SPOKEN TO THE DEFENDANT FOR HOURS IN PREPARATION FOR HER TESTIMONY.SO THE VIOLATION IS EVEN MORE FLAGRANT WITH RESPECT TO HER. AT LEAST THAT'S ACCORDING TO WHAT SHE SAID TO THE L.A. TIMES.SO COUNSEL HAS -- IS NOW CONTINUING TO PERPETRATE A FRAUD UPON THIS COURT, IS CONTINUING TO MAKE MISREPRESENTATIONS CONCERNING THE NATURE OF THE WITNESSES THAT THEY HAVE CONTACTED AND THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN THE CASE. HE IS STILL WITHHOLDING MORE INFORMATION.THERE ARE WITNESSES WHOSE NAMES WE STILL DON'T HAVE, AND OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE NO REPORTS. THAT'S A FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF THE LAW. AND NOW IT'S COMPOUNDED BY COUNSEL'S WILLFUL ASSERTIONS TO THE CONTRARY WHERE THE WITNESSES ARE TELLING US IN TERMS OF WHEN THEY WERE RETAINED.HOW CAN THAT POSSIBLY BE SWEPT UNDER THE RUG?

THANK YOU VERY MUCH.YOUR HONOR, IN ADDITION TO THE COMMENTS AND TO THE OBJECTIONS THAT WE LODGED WITH THE COURT IN CHAMBERS, I WOULD LIKE TO ADD ONE MORE POINT THAT WAS JUST BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION RECENTLY, AND THAT IS, YOUR HONOR, OUR REVIEW OF SECTION 1054.5(B) DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZE A JUDGE TO INSTRUCT THE JURY THAT A DISCOVERY VIOLATION BY DEFENSE COUNSEL, FOR EXAMPLE, MAY BE CONSIDERED BY THE JURY BEARING ON THE CREDIBILITY OF WITNESSES.AND I THINK THAT THERE IS THE DANGER THAT THE LANGUAGE OF THE PROPOSED INSTRUCTION BY THE COURT GIVES SUCH A SUGGESTION, NOR DOES CASE LAW, YOUR HONOR, AUTHORIZE SUCH A JURY INSTRUCTION.INDEED, WE SUBMIT THAT IT WOULD BE COMPLETELY IRRATIONAL TO MAKE A CONNECTION BETWEEN A LAWYER'S DISCOVERY OBLIGATIONS AND THE CREDIBILITY OF AN INDEPENDENT WITNESS.I THINK, YOUR HONOR, THAT THERE IS A DANGER BY SUCH A NEXUS TRIGGERING PROFOUND STATE AND FEDERAL VIOLATIONS, BOTH DUE PROCESS AND OF A SIXTH AMENDMENT NATURE.AND I WOULD URGE THE COURT TO STRIKE THAT CONNECTION IN THE COURT'S RULING.SECONDARILY, YOUR HONOR, I RESPECT -- THOUGH I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE COURT'S FINDING THAT THE VIOLATION TO TURN OVER THE WITNESS STATEMENTS OF MISS GERCHAS WAS INTENTIONAL.I SUGGEST THAT THE -- THAT BEFORE THE COURT CAN PROPERLY MAKE SUCH A RULING, THAT IS, THAT THERE WAS AN INTENTIONAL VIOLATION TO GAIN TACTICAL ADVANTAGE, THAT THE COURT SHOULD MOST PROPERLY CONSIDER THAT ASPECT WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A SWORN DECLARATION THAT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUBMIT MYSELF TO THIS COURT SO THAT THE COURT COULD THEN HAVE FACTS UPON WHICH THE COURT MIGHT MAKE SUCH A FINDING IF THE COURT IS RULING THAT A VIOLATION IS BEING IMPOSED AND A SANCTION IS BEING IMPOSED BASED ON THE COURT'S BELIEF THAT THERE WAS AN INTENTIONAL VIOLATION RATHER THAN AN INADVERTENT ACCIDENT AS WE CONTEND.

SIMPSON.IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT MR. SIMPSON IS IN COURT MOST OF THE DAY EVERY DAY, THAT WOULD PRECLUDE HER PHYSICAL CAPABILITY OF HAVING AMASSED THAT NUMBER OF HOURS, UNLESS SHE HAD BEEN RETAINED QUITE A LONG TIME AGO, AND ALL OF THIS FLIES IN THE FACE OF COUNSEL'S DIRECT ASSERTIONS TO THE COURT THAT SHE HAD RECENTLY BEEN RETAINED.IT HAS NOW BEEN EXPOSED TO BE AN ABSOLUTE FALSEHOOD AND I THINK THE ARTICLE AS WELL IN THE L.A. TIMES MAKES THAT CLEAR ALSO, THAT SHE WAS ACTUALLY CONTACTED THROUGH GERALDINE STAHLY IN THE SUMMER, WHICH THEN MAKES IT PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE TO HAVE AMASSED THAT NUMBER OF HOURS.SO I THINK THAT WHAT THE COURT HAS BEFORE IT IS FURTHER IMPEACHMENT OF DEFENSE COUNSEL'S MOST RECENT ASSERTIONS EVEN OF HAVING BEEN RECENTLY RETAINED.

WALKER RELEASED JANUARY 26TH, AND THE PARAGRAPH, THE ENDING PARAGRAPH READS AS FOLLOWS:""AS WE BEGAN TO EXAMINE THE EVIDENCE OVER THE PAST FIVE MONTHS, WHICH INCLUDED SOME FORTY HOURS OF EVALUATION OF O.J. SIMPSON, WE REALIZED THAT THE POTENTIAL FOR LONG-TERM HARM TO BATTERED WOMAN WAS PRESENT IF THE FACT PATTERNS AND SIGNIFICANCE OF BATTERING IN THIS CASE WERE MISINTERPRETED, DISTORTED OR OTHERWISE MISUSED BY EITHER SIDE.""SO THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE BEEN EXAMINING THE EVIDENCE FOR THE PAST FIVE MONTHS I THINK IN FACT SUPPORTS YOUR POSITION THAT IN FACT THERE WAS A RELATIONSHIP PRIOR TO JUST LAST WEEK.HOWEVER, HAVING SAID THAT, THE DEFENSE WAS NOT IN A POSTURE TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT TESTIMONY BY DR. WALKER WOULD BE RELEVANT UNTIL THE COURT RULED ON THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISSUES, AT WHICH POINT THE COURT, HAVING ALLOWED TESTIMONY OF SOME INCIDENTS AND HAVING EXCLUDED TESTIMONY AS TO OTHERS, THEN CLEARLY SET THE ISSUE BEFORE THE JURY.SO I ACCEPT MR. COCHRAN'S REPRESENTATION THAT HE DID NOT FORMALLY MAKE A DETERMINATION WHETHER OR NOT TO CALL DR. WALKER UNTIL AFTER THE COURT'S RULING ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, BUT THAT ALSO CAUSES ME TO BELIEVE THAT IF THERE HAS BEEN FIVE MONTHS OF PREPARATION, THAT THERE OUGHT TO BE SOME NOTES AROUND.

THESE DISCLOSURES MUST BE MADE BEFORE TRIAL IF THE WITNESSES OR EVIDENCE ARE THEN KNOWN. THESE LAWS EXIST TO PROMOTE THE ASCERTAINMENT OF TRUTH IN TRIALS, TO SAVE COURT TIME AND TO AVOID THE NECESSITY FOR FREQUENT INTERRUPTIONS AND POSTPONEMENTS.DURING THE COURSE OF THE OPENING STATEMENTS DEFENSE COUNSEL MENTIONED WITNESSES WHO HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN DISCLOSED TO THE PROSECUTION OR WHOSE WRITTEN STATEMENTS WERE NOT GIVEN TO THE PROSECUTION BEFORE TRIAL, AS REQUIRED BY LAW.THIS VIOLATION OF THE LAW -- THIS WAS A VIOLATION OF THE LAW AND ONE OF THE CAUSES OF THE TWO-DAY DELAY, INCLUDING THE ABSENCE OF MR.

#MR. COCHRAN: ,"THIS MORNING AGAIN I WILL BE ASSISTED BY MR. CARL DOUGLAS WITH REGARD TO SOME GRAPHICS THAT WE HAVE, AND BY MR. HOWARD HARRIS HERE ALSO WITH REGARD TO THE GRAPHICS.AS YOU WILL RECALL FROM OUR DISCUSSION LAST WEEK, IN DISCUSSING THE EVIDENCE WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE CORONER'S OFFICE AND TALKED ABOUT WHAT WE EXPECT THE EVIDENCE TO SHOW REGARDING THEIR SHORTFALLS. WE HAVE SOUGHT TO REPLY TO THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP BY THE TWO PROSECUTORS IN THEIR OPENING STATEMENTS.AND I BELIEVE THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE HAD REACHED THE POINT WHERE I TOLD YOU WE WERE ABOUT TO DISCUSS THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THEIR HANDLING OF THIS MATTER.I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT WAS THE MAIN INVESTIGATING AGENCY IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE. THE TWO MAIN DETECTIVES ARE DETECTIVE PHILIP VANNATTER AND DETECTIVE TOM LANGE. THEY ARE FROM THE ROBBERY/HOMICIDE DIVISION AND THEY WERE ASSIGNED THIS CASE IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OF JUNE 13, 1994.IN THE COURSE OF OUR DISCUSSION TODAY WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THE EVIDENCE WHICH WAS SEIZED OR COLLECTED AT THE SCENE OF BUNDY AND ALSO AT ROCKINGHAM.MAY WE HAVE THE FIRST GRAPHIC NOW.UNDER THIS SCENARIO, WE EXPECT TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF THE EVIDENCE, THAT IS, WHETHER OR NOT THIS EVIDENCE IS CAPABLE OF YOUR BELIEF, WHETHER OR NOT IT IS EVIDENCE THAT IS CORRECT AND APPROPRIATE. HOW WAS IT COLLECTED?AND SO FOR THE GRAPHIC THERE, ALL THE EVIDENCE PICKED UP AT THE NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON CONDO AT THE TOP, THE EVIDENCE PICKED UP AT THE SIMPSON HOME ON ROCKINGHAM, THE EVIDENCE FROM THE BRONCO, ANY BLOOD, ALL WENT FIRST THROUGH THE LAPD THERE AND THEN ULTIMATELY FROM LAPD IT WAS SENT OUT TO THE VARIOUS LABS, BE IT THE FBI, CELLMARK OR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.THIS GRAPHIC SEEKS TO PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE. YOU CAN SEE THE LAPD THEN REMAINS A FOCAL POINT IN THEIR COLLECTION OF ALL THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO LOOK AT.WE EXPECT THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THIS EVIDENCE THAT WAS COLLECTED AT THESE VARIOUS LOCATIONS THAT YOU HAVE JUST SEEN WAS CONTAMINATED, COMPROMISED AND ULTIMATELY CORRUPTED. IN THE COURSE OF THE EVIDENCE WE EXPECT TO SHOW THAT.NEXT.NOW, BRIEFLY LAST WEEK I SPOKE TO YOU ABOUT A DETECTIVE NAMED MARK FUHRMAN. MR. FUHRMAN AND HIS PARTNER, MR. PHILLIPS, WORKED WEST LOS ANGELES HOMICIDE, AND THEY ARE THE TWO DETECTIVES WHO FIRST WERE ASSIGNED TO THIS CASE BEFORE ROBBERY/HOMICIDE GOT INVOLVED.ROBBERY/HOMICIDE IS DOWNTOWN, I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW. THESE TWO DETECTIVES WORKED IN WEST LOS ANGELES WHERE THESE CRIMES HAD OCCURRED AND THEY WERE THE FIRST ONES TO ARRIVE AT THE SCENE.ALTHOUGH YOU DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT MR. FUHRMAN IN THE COURSE OF THE OPENING STATEMENT OF THE PROSECUTION, WE THINK HE WILL BE A KEY WITNESS IN THIS CASE.LET ME TELL YOU WHY I THINK HE WILL BE A KEY WITNESS. I BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT HE AND HIS PARTNER, DETECTIVE PHILLIPS ARRIVED AT THAT SCENE SOMETIME AFTER TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING. THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THESE BODIES WERE FOUND SOMEWHERE AROUND 12:15 ON JUNE 13, 1994.AFTER ARRIVING AT THE SCENE MR. FUHRMAN DID A NUMBER OF THINGS. YOU SAW HIM IN ONE OF THE PICTURES LAST WEEK WHERE HE WAS POINTING DOWN AT ALLEGEDLY THE GLOVE AND THE CAP THAT WAS UNDER SOME SHRUBBERY, IF YOU RECALL. THAT WAS A PICTURE OF MR. FUHRMAN AT THAT POINT. YOU NOTICE THAT HE HAD -- HIS SHOES WERE NOT COVERED, THAT HE HAD WALKED IN THAT LOCATION AT THAT POINT WITHOUT SHOES BEING COVERED, THAT HE MADE A NUMBER OF DISCOVERIES AT THAT PARTICULAR POINT.THAT THERE WAS A PHOTOGRAPHER AT SOME TIME AT THAT SCENE, AT THE BUNDY LOCATION, THAT THIS PHOTOGRAPHER WAS THEN SUMMONED, ALONG WITH PHILLIPS, HIS PARTNER, AND VANNATTER AND LANGE, TO GO OVER TO THE ROCKINGHAM ADDRESS.WE EXPECT THE EVIDENCE WILL BE THAT PRESUMABLY THEY WERE GOING OVER THERE TO GIVE NOTICE TO MR. SIMPSON ABOUT THE DEATH OF HIS EX-WIFE AND PRESUMABLY THAT THE CHILDREN WERE IN POLICE CUSTODY AT THAT POINT.APPARENTLY THE PARTIES WERE NOT NOTIFIED OF EITHER MR. -- MRS. NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON OR THE GOLDMANS AT THIS POINT, BUT THEY WENT OVER TO O.J. SIMPSON'S RESIDENCE.YOU RECALL ALSO I TOLD YOU LAST WEEK THAT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN HAD PREVIOUSLY HAD CONTACT WITH THE SIMPSONS. HE HAD RESPONDED TO THE SO-CALLED 1985 INCIDENT. HE DIDN'T WRITE A REPORT AT THAT TIME, BUT IN 1989 HE WROTE A WRITTEN REPORT AND IN THAT REPORT HE TALKS ABOUT THE INCIDENTS OF -- THE '85 INCIDENT BEING INDELIBLY IMPRESSED UPON HIS MIND, SO HE DID HAVE CONTACT, HAD BEEN TO THE ROCKINGHAM LOCATION.NOW, THE EVIDENCE I THINK WILL SHOW THAT HE WILL ALLEGE THAT THE REASON WHY HE WAS STILL LEADING DETECTIVE VANNATTER AND LANGE OVER TO THE ROCKINGHAM ADDRESS IS BECAUSE HE KNEW WHERE IT WAS, BUT I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL ALSO SHOW FROM DETECTIVE VANNATTER THAT HE, TOO, HAD ALSO WORKED IN WEST LOS ANGELES AND HE KNEW THE WAY OVER THERE.BUT AT ANY RATE I THINK YOU WILL FIND THAT THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT ALL FOUR OF THESE DETECTIVES, THIS IS PRIOR OF COURSE TO THE CORONER EVER BEING NOTIFIED, LEAVE THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE AND THEY GO OVER TO ROCKINGHAM.ONCE AT ROCKINGHAM DETECTIVE FUHRMAN OF COURSE -- NOW BY THIS TIME THE CASE IS NOW IN THE HANDS OF THE CAPABLE INDIVIDUALS FROM DOWNTOWN ROBBERY/HOMICIDE.HE CONTINUES TO PLAY AN INTEGRAL PART IN THIS CASE. I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT HE, IN LOOKING AT THE BRONCO -- NOW, IT IS STILL, BY ALL ACCOUNTS, I THINK STILL DARK OUTSIDE -- BUT IN LOOKING AT THE BRONCO IT IS NOW MAYBE GETTING CLOSE TO FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING, MAYBE LIGHT IS ABOUT UP, HE DISCOVERS WHAT HE BELIEVES IS A SPECK OF BLOOD ON THE DOOR. THIS IS DETECTIVE FUHRMAN. HE DISCOVERS SOME MORE BLOOD ALLEGEDLY DOWN TOWARD THE BOTTOM OF THE DOOR, THAT AT SOME POINT WHEN THESE OFFICERS CAN'T ROUSE ANYBODY AT THE LOCATION, DETECTIVE FUHRMAN IS THE ONE WHO CLIMBS OVER THE WALL TO GO INTO THE PREMISES.ONCE IN THE PREMISES, HE IS THE ONE WHO INTERROGATES MR. KATO KAELIN, THAT HE IS THE ONE WHO ALSO, AFTER TALKING TO MR. KAELIN, GOES BACK AND FINDS THIS GLOVE, THE ALLEGED RIGHT GLOVE, AT ROCKINGHAM.WE HAVE NOW FOR YOU SOME VIDEO RELATING TO DETECTIVE MARK FUHRMAN, AND I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAS TO SAY WITH REGARD TO THE GLOVE.NOW, IN FAIRNESS TO DETECTIVE FUHRMAN, THE QUESTION HE IS GOING TO ASK IS ABOUT THE GLOVE AND THEY TALK ABOUT THE GLOVE, BUT IN HIS RESPONSE, YOU WILL SEE HE AT SOME POINT TALKS ABOUT SEEING THEM AT THE FOOT OF MR. GOLDMAN.MR. HARRIS, SIR.
","JANUARY 30, 1995 ",9:10 A.M.
#MR. COCHRAN: ,"YOU RECALL AND HEARD THE TESTIMONY THAT ""I COULD SEE THEM DOWN AT HIS FEET,"" AND THE QUESTION WILL BE SEEKING TO ESTABLISH IN THIS TRIAL IS WHEN HE SAID HE SAW THEM DOWN AT THE FEET, WAS HE TALKING ABOUT TWO GLOVES AT THAT POINT?NOW, THIS DETECTIVE PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE AS HE REMAINS AT THE ROCKINGHAM LOCATION. YOU RECALL LAST WEEK I MENTIONED THAT WE EXPECT TO CALL A WITNESS BY THE NAME OF ROSA LOPEZ AT SOMEPLACE -- AT SOMEPLACE IN THE CASE.ROSA LOPEZ GIVES NEXT DOOR TO MR. SIMPSON. SHE IS A LADY WHO WAS EMPLOYED BY THE FAMILY THERE. SHE IS THEIR HOUSEKEEPER.AND THERE WILL, WE BELIEVE, BE TESTIMONY THAT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN HAD A CONVERSATION WITH ROSA LOPEZ ON THE EARLY MORNING HOURS, AFTER ABOUT 7:30, EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING, ON JUNE 13, 1994, AND AT THAT TIME ROSA LOPEZ SHARED WITH HIM HER OBSERVATIONS THAT SHE HAD BEEN OUTSIDE THE NIGHT BEFORE AND THAT THE BRONCO VEHICLE PARKED THERE AT THE CURB AT ROCKINGHAM WAS PARKED THERE AT APPROXIMATELY 8:15, 8:30. IT WAS PARKED AT KIND OF A UNIQUE ANGLE. SHE HAD REASON TO REMEMBER THAT AS SHE WENT OUTSIDE TO WALK HER DOG.SHE WILL ALSO TESTIFY THAT SHE CAME BACK OUTSIDE TO WALK THAT SAME DOG AT ABOUT 10:20 P.M. SHE SAW THE BRONCO PARKED IN THAT SAME LOCATION AND IT HAD NOT BEEN MOVED, THAT THE NEXT MORNING, WHEN DETECTIVE FUHRMAN HAD SPOKEN WITH HER, THE BRONCO WAS STILL PARKED AT THAT SAME ANGLE, AS THOUGH IT HAD NOT BEEN MOVED ALL NIGHT.SHE WILL SHARE WITH YOU WHAT, IF ANYTHING, SHE SAID TO THE DETECTIVE THAT MORNING. YOU WILL FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT HE REDUCED ANY OF THIS CONVERSATION TO A REPORT, WHETHER OR NOT THAT REPORT WAS EVER FORWARDED TO ANYBODY, WHETHER HE TOLD ANY OF THE DETECTIVES ABOUT IT.WE EXPECT THAT SHE ALSO INDICATED TO DETECTIVE FUHRMAN THAT MR. SIMPSON LEFT THE -- HIS RESIDENCE SOMEWHERE AROUND 9:00 -- NINE O'CLOCK, AND THERE WILL BE TESTIMONY THAT HE AND MR. KATO KAELIN WENT TO GET A MC DONALD'S HAMBURGER, THAT SHE WAS AWARE AND HEARD HIS VOICE WHEN HE LEFT AND SHE HEARD WHAT SHE BELIEVED TO BE PROWLERS DURING THIS PERIOD OF TIME AND BECAME QUITE FRIGHTENED.I EXPECT THAT SHE WILL ALSO TESTIFY THAT SHE HEARD MR. SIMPSON'S VOICE AT AROUND ELEVEN O'CLOCK, OR A LITTLE AFTER, AND WHEN SHE ALSO HEARD HIS VOICE HE APPEARED AS THOUGH HE WAS LEAVING AND SHE DID NOT HEAR ANY VOICE ANY MORE THAT PARTICULAR NIGHT.THAT AFTER MR. SIMPSON'S VOICE WAS NO LONGER HEARD, AFTER HE PRESUMABLY HAD LEFT THE ROCKINGHAM RESIDENCE, THAT SHE HAD HEARD MEN'S VOICES BEGINNING AT ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK, LASTING UNTIL ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING. SHE WAS NOT ABLE REALLY TO FALL ASLEEP UNTIL PERHAPS FOUR O'CLOCK THAT MORNING AND WAS AWAKENED BECAUSE I THINK THE GARDENER CAME THAT MORNING.AND SHE ALSO HAD THIS CONVERSATION WITH DETECTIVE FUHRMAN WHO CAME AND SHOWED HIS BADGE AND THEN CAME INSIDE OF HER HOUSE.SO WE THINK THAT IN TRUTH AND IN FACT DETECTIVE MARK FUHRMAN WILL PLAY A VERY, VERY CRITICAL ROLE IN THIS CASE REGARDING HIS TESTIMONY.NOW, LET'S GO BACK, IF WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE LAPD, AND LET'S LOOK AT THE STATEMENTS REGARDING THE CORONER. YOU WILL RECALL LAST WEEK I INDICATED TO YOU THAT THE CORONER'S OFFICE FOR SOME REASON WASN'T CALLED INITIALLY. THEY ARRIVED AT THE SCENE ALMOST TEN HOURS AFTER THESE BODIES HAD BEEN DISCOVERED.LET'S LOOK FOR A MOMENT, USING THE ELMO WITH MR. HARRIS, AT THE SEQUENCE OF WHAT TOOK PLACE, AND FOR THE RECORD, I WILL READ CERTAIN THINGS INTO THE RECORD FROM THE TRANSCRIPT, YOUR HONOR.THE UNDERLYING PORTIONS I WILL READ FOR THE RECORD. THIS PURPORTS TO BE, AND WE WILL ESTABLISH THAT AT THE TIME OF TRIAL, THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT TOOK PLACE ON JUNE 13, 1994, AT ABOUT 6:49 IN THE MORNING, JUST BEFORE SEVEN O'CLOCK, AND IT IS A TELEPHONIC COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE DEPUTY CORONER, PAUL WILLIS, AND DETECTIVE PHILLIPS OF THE LAPD, PHILLIPS BEING FUHRMAN'S PARTNER.""DETECTIVE PHILLIPS: I GOT A DOUBLE HOMICIDE THAT WE WANT TO LET YOU KNOW ABOUT. IT IS GOING TO BE -- THE PRESS IS GOING TO BE CRAWLING ON US LIKE ANTS WHEN THEY FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.""DETECTIVE PHILLIPS: THIS IS THE FIRST CALL AND WE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO YET, BUT WE NEED TO GET YOU GUYS ROLLING OUT HERE SO THAT WE CAN GET THESE BODIES WHICH ARE VISIBLE FROM THE STREET OUT HERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.""IF I CAN DIGRESS FOR JUST A MOMENT. YOU WILL RECALL THAT HE IS SAYING FROM PHILLIPS TO THE CORONER'S OFFICE AT 6:49 FOR BODIES THAT WERE DISCOVERED BY THE POLICE AT 12:15 A.M.HE ALSO SAYS SOMETHING THAT I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT IS VERY INTERESTING WHEN HE SAYS THAT:""WE CAN -- GET YOU ROLLING OUT HERE FOR THESE BODIES WHICH ARE VISIBLE FROM THE STREET.""AND YOU WILL RECALL THAT WHEN I SPOKE TO YOU LAST WEEK ABOUT ELLEN ARRONSON AND DAN MANDEL WALKING PAST THIS LOCATION AT 10:25, NOT HEARING ANYTHING, NOT SEEING ANYTHING ON THE SIDEWALK DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF 875, AND YOU HAVE SEEN THE OTHER PHOTOGRAPHS, WHAT YOU COULD SEE FROM THAT SIDEWALK, AND IT IS CLEAR FROM HIS STATEMENT YOU COULD SEE THESE BODIES, AND OF COURSE THERE WAS ALL THE BLOOD AT THE SCENE.CONTINUING ON:""WE'RE KIND -- WE KIND OF NOT FOLLOWING PROCEDURE, BUT WE ARE KIND OF ASKING A FAVOR, AND YOU KNOW, KIND OF WORK A LITTLE BIT ON THIS ONE.""SO WE HAVE THE DETECTIVE AT THIS POINT, THEY ARE NOT FOLLOWING THEIR OWN PROCEDURES AND THEY ARE ASKING THE CORONER'S OFFICE TO DO THEM A FAVOR AND COOPERATE WITH THEM.THANK YOU. NEXT PAGE. PAGE 240, FOR THE RECORD, DETECTIVE PHILLIPS AGAIN STILL TALKING TO THE DEPUTY CORONER, MR. WILLIS.""DETECTIVE PHILLIPS: WELL, YOU CAN SEE THEM, YEAH, FROM THE STREET HERE. THEY'RE -- THEY'RE A LITTLE OFF THE SIDEWALK HERE IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE, BUT THE PROBLEM IS WE'RE GOING -- WHEN THIS THING BREAKS WE ARE GOING TO HAVE NEWS FROM EVERYWHERE HERE. IT IS GOING TO BE A HIGH-PROFILE TYPE DEAL. IT IS THE -- IT IS THE EX-WIFE OF A VERY PROMINENT SPORTSCASTER OR SPORTS CELEBRITY.""THEN HE IS ASKED A LITTLE BIT ABOVE, HE SAYS:""OKAY. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TRUST YOU ON THIS. IT IS O.J. SIMPSON'S EX-WIFE.""THAT IS PHILLIPS TELLING THE CORONER AGAIN AND HE GOES ON TO SAY -- THE CORONER SAYS:""OH, BOY. OKAY, UMM.""AND PHILLIPS SAYS:""AND HE IS IN CHICAGO.""AND WILLIS SAYS:""HE DOES NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS?""AND PHILLIPS SAYS:""HE KNOWS NOW AND THAT IS WHAT IS GOING TO BREAK THIS THING WIDE OPEN.""NEXT PAGE, PAGE 241, MR. HARRIS, SIR.NOW, MR. WILLIS HEARS THIS AND I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW HE IS THE CORONER, HE WANTS TO GET ROLLING, AND ON THIS PAGE, OKAY, PAGE 241, HERE IS WHAT WILLIS SAYS:""OKAY, UMM, YOU WANT US ROLL OUT NOW?""AND THEN DETECTIVE PHILLIPS SAYS:""HOLD ON A SECOND. TOM, TOM.""AND I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW WHEN HE SAYS, ""TOM, TOM,"" I THINK IT IS DETECTIVE TOM LANGE. SO YOU ARE NOT CONFUSED, THERE ARE TWO TOM LANGS IN THIS CASE AND THERE IS THE TOM LANG ON THE SIDEWALK AND WHO SEES NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON ON THE SIDEWALK AND THERE IS DETECTIVE TOM LANGE AND HE SAYS:""HOLD ON A SECOND. TOM, TOM, DO YOU WANT THE CORONER NOW?""NO.""HOLD ON A SECOND. HOW LONG?""OKAY. YOU ARE JUST GETTING THE FIRST CALL.""AND PHILLIPS GOES ON TO SAY:""WE WILL GIVE YOU A CALL BACK WHEN WE WANT THEM MOVED,"" PRESUMABLY MEANING THE BODIES, I SUPPOSE.""DETECTIVE PHILLIPS: IT IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE ABOUT AN HOUR TO AN HOUR AND A HALF.""SO HERE WE HAVE THEM CALLING MORE THAN SIX HOURS, THE VERY FIRST TIME, 6:49. THEN WHEN THE CORONER WANTS TO ROLL, SAYS, ""DO YOU WANT US TO ROLL NOW,"" THEY THEN SAY, ""MAYBE AN HOUR TO AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER.""MOVE TO THE NEXT PAGE PLEASE. ALL RIGHT.PHILLIPS SAYS:""WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO GIVE THIS TO THE SUPERVISOR BECAUSE I'M LEAVING NOW.""PHILLIPS SAYS:""ALL RIGHT.""WILLIS SAYS:""AND TELL THEM, UMM, THAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE CALLING BACK ABOUT AN HOUR, AN HOUR AND A HALF."" PHILLIPS SAYS:""OKAY. AND AGAIN WE DON'T WANT THAT OUT.""THAT ESSENTIALLY ENDS THE FIRST CONVERSATION. THEY PUT IT IN CONTEXT. LET'S SEE IF AND WHEN THEY CALL BACK.AND WE WILL PRESENT EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT AT ABOUT 8:08 IN THE MORNING ON JUNE 13, 1994, THERE WAS IN FACT A SECOND CONVERSATION BETWEEN DETECTIVE PHILLIPS AND A MR. RICHARD HEATH THEN OF THE CORONER'S OFFICE.DETECTIVE PHILLIPS SAYS:""WE ALREADY GAVE YOU GUYS THE FIRST CALL SEVERAL HOURS AGO ON BUNDY.""HEATH: YEAH.""PHILLIPS: OKAY. CAN YOU GIVE ME AN ETA,"" AN ESTIMATED TIME OF ARRIVAL, ""IF YOU STARTED ROLLING NOW?""SOME CONVERSATION WITH PHILLIPS -- WITH HEATH, RATHER, AND HEATH GOES ON TO SAY:""YEAH, MY NAME IS HEATH, H-E-A-T-H, AND I COULD GIVE YOU APPROXIMATE ARRIVAL TIME OF DRIVING TIME FROM THE MAIN OFFICE IN ABOUT MAYBE ANOTHER FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MINUTES ADDED TO THAT.""AND PHILLIPS SAYS:""OKAY, SO YOU ARE TALKING -- TALKING A GOOD 45 MINUTES THEN?"" DETECTIVE PHILLIPS:""TO AN HOUR.""NEXT PAGE, SIR.DETECTIVE PHILLIPS SAYS:""YOU ARE NOT GOING TO ROLL THEN FOR AN HOUR?""AND MR. HEATH RESPONDS:""NO, WE WILL BE THERE WITHIN 45 MINUTES TO AN HOUR.""NOW, WE THINK THAT THIS EVIDENCE IS VERY IMPORTANT EVIDENCE BECAUSE IT STARTS RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS INVESTIGATION BY THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT.FIRST THEY HAVE ALREADY FAILED TO NOTIFY AND THEN WHEN THEY DO NOTIFY THEY HAVE GOT SO MUCH WORK TO DO YET THAT WE KNOW THAT THE CORONER'S OFFICE DOESN'T COME OUT THERE UNTIL -- THEY DON'T GET THE FINAL CALL UNTIL 8:08, SO WE KNOW PERHAPS ACCORDING TO THIS MAN, MR. HEATH, IT IS AT LEAST ONE HOUR OR SO AFTER THAT BEFORE THEY EVEN GET OUT TO THE SCENE.YOU'VE HEARD ME MENTION DETECTIVE VANNATTER WHO IS THE DETECTIVE IN CHARGE OF THIS SCENE, VERY EXPERIENCED DETECTIVE FROM ROBBERY/HOMICIDE.AND AS WITH ALL OF THE WITNESSES IN THIS CASE, THEIR CREDIBILITY WILL BE CHALLENGED AND WE WILL BE LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT THEIR CREDIBILITY AND WHAT THEY DID THAT NIGHT AND HOW THEY CONDUCTED THEMSELVES. YOU MUST DO THAT ALSO WITH DETECTIVE VANNATTER.DETECTIVE VANNATTER ON THIS PARTICULAR MORNING, AT ABOUT 10:45, SOUGHT A SEARCH WARRANT. THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW MR. SIMPSON WAS NOT IN LOS ANGELES; HE WAS IN CHICAGO. THE DETECTIVE HAD GONE OVER THE WALL FIRST BUT AFTER THEY SOUGHT A SEARCH WARRANT, THAT IS NOT RELEVANT, BUT WHAT IS RELEVANT IS THE CREDIBILITY OF THE DETECTIVE AND WHAT HE SAID TO THE JUDGE IN SEEKING TO GET THIS SEARCH WARRANT.MR.

IT WAS NOT HUMAN BLOOD. THEY COULD NOT CONFIRM HUMAN BLOOD, SO THERE WAS ANOTHER MISSTATEMENT TO THE JUDGE AT THAT PARTICULAR POINT.NOW, IN ADDITION TO THAT, AND I WILL READ THESE FOR YOU, THE OTHER INACCURACIES OF SOME IMPORTANCE THAT WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW ARE AS FOLLOWS:THE DETECTIVES, IN SEEKING THIS PARTICULAR WARRANT, NEVER DISCLOSED TO THE JUDGE THE MANNER IN WHICH ENTRY WAS MADE. THAT IS, THEY HAD ALREADY CLIMBED OVER THE WALL. THEY NEVER BOTHERED TELLING THE JUDGE THAT.AND FINALLY, THE FINAL INACCURACY THAT I THINK YOU WILL FIND OF SOME GREAT RELEVANCE, THE FACT THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD IN FACT BEEN CONTACTED BY DETECTIVE PHILLIPS AND HAD VOLUNTEERED TO COME HOME, TAKING AWAY FROM THE WARRANT ANY IMPLICATION THAT HE HAD SOMEHOW FLED THE SCENE. THAT WAS NEVER DONE.NOW, AGAIN, THIS IS THE EVIDENCE FROM THEIR FILES, AND BASED UPON WHAT THEIR LEAD INVESTIGATOR SAID TO A JUDGE.AND AT SOME POINT IN MY OPENING STATEMENT TODAY I WANT TO CHARACTERIZE FOR YOU HOW MR. SIMPSON CONDUCTED HIMSELF IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OF JUNE 13 WITH THE WAY THAT THE DETECTIVES CONDUCTED THEMSELVES.THIS BRINGS US THEN TO A DISCUSSION OF THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE, AND YOU RECALL BRIEFLY THE OTHER DAY I TALKED TO YOU ABOUT WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW ULTIMATELY THIS WAS A PLACE OF THE GATHERING OF THE EVIDENCE AND WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE CRIME SCENE TO SECURE THIS AREA, THAT PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE WALKING THROUGH THE EVIDENCE, SHOULD NOT BE TRACKING UP THE EVIDENCE, SHOULD NOT BE TOUCHING THINGS WITHOUT GLOVES, SHOULD BE IN SOME WAY PROTECTED BECAUSE THIS EVIDENCE IS ALL VERY, VERY SENSITIVE.WE WOULD EXPECT THAT HOPEFULLY BY THE TIME OF TRIAL YOU WILL ACTUALLY HAVE SOME FOOTAGE FROM LOCAL TELEVISIONS OF HOW THE DETECTIVE AND HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE OUT THERE AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE IN FACT WEARING ANYTHING OVER THEIR SHOES.YOU HAVE ALREADY SEEN IN THE PROSECUTION'S OPENING STATEMENT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN'S SHOES AND HOW THEY EXISTED AT THE TIME. WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THIS SCENE WAS TRACKED AND TRAIPSED UP AND THE GATHERING OF EVIDENCE WAS A COMPLETE DISASTER, AND WE FEEL THAT THE EVIDENCE WILL BE SHOWN TO BE CONTAMINATED, COMPROMISED AND CORRUPTED, AS WE HAVE INDICATED TO YOU EARLIER.NOW, YOUR HONOR, BEFORE WE SHOW THIS NEXT GRAPHIC, I WANT TO SAY A WORD TO COUNSEL AND YOU MAY WANT TO USE YOUR SWITCH.

#MR. COCHRAN: ,"THANK YOU.WE EXPECT, AS WE INDICATED LAST WEEK, TO SHOW THAT BASED AT THIS PARTICULAR CRIME SCENE AT BUNDY, THERE WILL BE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE EXPECT THE EVIDENCE TO SHOW, THAT ONE OF WHICH IS THIS CRIME SCENE AND THE PATTERNS AT THE CRIME SCENE ARE CONSISTENT WITH A MAJOR STRUGGLE.MR. RON GOLDMAN'S BLOOD, AS I TOLD YOU, SHOULD BE ALL OVER THE PERPETRATOR, ESPECIALLY IN THE UPPER AND MIDDLE PARTS OF THE PERPETRATOR'S BODY. YOU WILL RECALL THAT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN'S DESCRIPTION THIS MORNING WHERE HE DESCRIBED THIS RATHER SMALL AREA WHERE MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS FOUND, AND HE TALKED ABOUT A FENCE AND YOU HAVE SOME PICTURES WITH A TREE IN THE AREA. IT IS A VERY SMALL AREA. HE HAD TO GO OUTSIDE TO LOOK OUTSIDE THE FENCE TO SEE WHERE THE BODY WAS. IT IS A VERY SMALL AREA.I THINK YOU WILL FIND THAT IF THERE WAS THIS MAJOR CONFRONTATION, AND YOU RECALL LAST WEEK MR. GOLDMAN'S HAND, BUT I EXPECT THERE TO BE TESTIMONY THAT HIS HAND CAME IN BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA WITH ONE OF THE PERPETRATORS THERE AND THERE WOULD BE SOME MARK OR SOME INJURIES, IT WOULD SEEM, PLUS THERE ARE TREES, THIS FENCE AND THERE WAS A VIOLENT STRUGGLE.SO IF YOU RECALL THE PICTURES OFMR. O.J. SIMPSON LAST WEEK, YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT EVIDENCE AS TO THE LACK OF ANY MARKS, BRUISES OR ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE.IN THE AREA -- WE EXPECT THE SCENE TO ALSO SHOW THAT IN THE AREA WHERE THESE MURDERS TOOK PLACE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FOOTPRINTS IN A VERY SMALL AREA, WHICH MEANS THAT MOST LIKELY THE PERPETRATOR HAD TO BE THERE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, THAT THERE WAS THIS PATTERN OF FIGHTING.I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL BE IN THIS CASE THAT MR. GOLDMAN'S BLOOD IS ON DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE LOCATION, WHICH MEANS THAT HE, TOO, WAS MOVING AROUND, SO THERE WAS THIS KIND OF A CONFRONTATION OR THIS FIGHT THAT WENT ON OVER A PERIOD OF TIME BECAUSE ONE IS FIGHTING FOR ONE'S LIFE, AND AS YOU KNOW, IT WAS A VIOLENT STRUGGLE IN WHICH HE ULTIMATELY WAS STABBED SOME 31 TIMES -- 30 TIMES.THE PROSECUTOR INDICATED TO YOU ALL THIS HAPPENED VERY FAST AND I THINK THAT YOU WILL SEE FROM THE EVIDENCE THAT THAT IS NOT EXACTLY CORRECT, GIVEN THE SITUATION WHEN ONE IS FIGHTING VALIANTLY FOR THEIR LIFE.THERE WAS SOME TESTIMONY LAST WEEK ABOUT CERTAIN BLOOD DROPS I THINK BY THE PROSECUTORS THAT WERE AT OR NEAR THE MANY FOOTPRINTS AND I THINK THAT YOU WILL FIND THAT IT WILL BE VERY UNUSUAL AND THAT IT WILL BE A REMARKABLE OCCURRENCE THAT THERE ARE ONLY FOUR DROPS OF BLOOD THAT THEY TALK ABOUT AND SO MANY, MANY FOOTPRINTS.FURTHER, WE WILL LOOK VERY CLOSELY DURING THE COURSE OF THIS TRIAL AT THE GLOVE, AT BOTH GLOVES. WE WILL LOOK AT THE GLOVE FOUND AT ROCKINGHAM, THE RIGHT GLOVE. WE WILL LOOK AT THE GLOVE FOUND AT BUNDY. AND WE WILL BE LOOKING TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE ANY CUTS ON THOSE GLOVES CONSISTENT WITH ANY CUTS OR ANYTHING ON MR. O.J. SIMPSON'S HANDS.WE EXPECT, AS I MENTIONED TO YOU LAST WEEK, THERE WILL BE FINGERPRINTS ON THE RAILINGS THAT ARE FRESH AT BUNDY AND WE THINK THAT THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THOSE FINGERPRINTS ARE NOT O.J. SIMPSON'S FINGERPRINTS.THAT THERE ARE HAIRS ON THE CAP, THE GLOVE AT BUNDY THAT ARE NOT O.J. SIMPSON'S.THAT THERE IS AT THE CRIME SCENE, I BELIEVE YOU RECALL WHEN THE PROSECUTORS WERE MAKING THEIR CASE LAST WEEK, THERE IS A TRIANGULAR PIECE OF PAPER SHOWN IN THE PHOTOGRAPH NEAR NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S HEAD THAT WAS NEVER SAVED, APPARENTLY, BY THE POLICE. WE DON'T HAVE THAT.OF COURSE YOU HAVE ALREADY SEEN AND THERE WILL BE A NUMBER OF OTHER PHOTOGRAPHS OF PEOPLE WITH UNPROTECTED SHOES STANDING IN AND ABOUT THE CRIME SCENE.THERE WILL OF COURSE BE ALSO PHOTOGRAPHS OF CRIMINALISTS WITHOUT PROPER HEAD COVERING AND GLOVES ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN COLLECTING AND SO I HOPE THIS GIVES YOU KIND OF A PREVIEW OF HOW THESE DETECTIVES COLLECTED EVIDENCE AND HOW THEY DEALT WITH THIS PARTICULAR SCENE, A SCENE THAT WOULD BE BEST VIDEOTAPED SO COULD YOU SEE EVERYTHING THAT TOOK PLACE, OTHER THAN JUST STILL PHOTOGRAPHS, A SCENE THAT WOULD BE BEST PRESERVED WHERE ONLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE THEIR REAL BUSINESS ARE THERE, NOT PEOPLE JUST WALKING AROUND AND TRAIPSING THROUGH THE EVIDENCE.YOU WILL HEAR A LOT ABOUT THAT DURING THE COURSE OF THIS TRIAL.NEXT WE WILL COME TO THE BRONCO. REMEMBER ALL THESE PIECES OF EVIDENCE GO FROM THE LOCATION, SUCH AS THE BUNDY, THROUGH LAPD, TO SOME OTHER PLACE, SO LET'S NOW LOOK AT THE BRONCO, WHAT WE CALL THE BRONCO TIMELINE.MR.

THEN WITHIN A DAY THEREAFTER, ON JUNE 15, 1994, THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO VIERTEL'S AND THAT IS THE TOWING YARD I JUST SPOKE TO YOU ABOUT AND THAT IS THE PLACE WHERE THERE WAS -- THE ONLY INDICATION WAS HOLD FOR RELEASE TO THE HERTZ CORPORATION.SO YOU CAN SEE IN JUNE WHAT TOOK PLACE.NOW WE KNOW AND WE EXPECT THERE WILL BE TESTIMONY THAT AS EARLY AS JUNE 15, THE DAY THAT VEHICLE, THE BRONCO, WAS TOWED TO VIERTEL'S, THERE WERE DOCUMENTS TAKEN OUT OF THE DRIVER'S SIDE POUCH. WE EXPECT THERE WILL BE TESTIMONY FROM A MAN BY THE NAME OF JOHN MERAZ, M-E-R-A-Z. MR. MERAZ WILL INDICATE THAT HE -- THEY ALL KNEW DOWN THERE THIS IS O.J. SIMPSON'S VEHICLE.THAT HE GOT INSIDE THAT VEHICLE AND GETTING INSIDE HE TOOK SOME RECEIPTS OR INVOICES, AND I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL BE THAT SOME OF THOSE RECEIPTS OR INVOICES WERE MADE OUT OR IN THE NAME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON.SO I THINK YOU WILL FIND DURING THE COURSE OF THE EVIDENCE NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON ALSO DROVE THAT VEHICLE AND THIS WILL BE FURTHER EVIDENCE THAT SHE WAS IN THE VEHICLE, PERHAPS HAD GONE TO THE CLEANERS OR SOMEPLACE TO PICK UP SOME ITEM, BUT MR. MERAZ WILL TELL YOU THAT HE TOOK THESE ITEMS OUT OF THE DRIVER'S SIDE POUCH ON OR ABOUT JUNE 15, 1994. HE WILL SAY THAT HE PUT THOSE ITEMS BACK INTO THE BRONCO, BUT THE ITEMS WERE THEN SUBSEQUENTLY STOLEN OR TAKEN IN ANOTHER BURGLARY OF THIS PARTICULAR CAR THAT SUPPOSEDLY IS SECURE ON VIERTEL'S PROPERTY.THE UPSHOT OF IT IS THAT TODAY, SEVEN MONTHS PLUS LATER, WE DON'T HAVE ANY OF THOSE RECEIPTS. THEY HAVE BEEN STOLEN, THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN, THEY ARE GONE FROM THIS SUPPOSED SECURE VEHICLE IN THE CUSTODY OF THE POLICE OR IN VIERTEL'S.AND SO THIS BRONCO TIMELINE SEEKS TO SPELL THAT OUT FOR YOU. YOU WILL NOTE IN GOING BACK THERE WE HAVE A SMALLER PICTURE OF THE WOMAN TOUCHING THE BRONCO. THAT IS STILL WHILE IT IS AT THE SCENE.YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED ON THE 14TH AND THEN THE 15TH AND THEN WE KNOW MR. MERAZ TAKES THE DOCUMENTS INITIALLY ON THE 15TH AND I THINK HE SAYS HE PUTS THEM BACK ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. THEY ARE KIND OF LIKE SOUVENIRS, I SUPPOSE, IF YOU BELIEVE WHAT HE TELLS YOU, BUT VIERTEL'S DOES NOT REPORT THE REMOVAL OF THE DOCUMENT TO THE POLICE AND POLICE THE COMMISSION UNTIL JUNE 11, 1994, UNTIL ALMOST A MONTH LATER.THE OFFICIAL WORD COMES OUT THAT THESE DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN TAKEN AND THEY ARE MISSING AND OF COURSE THEY THEN START AN INVESTIGATION TO TRY AND FIND OUT WHERE THESE DOCUMENTS ARE.THIS BRONCO TIMELINE TALKS ABOUT THIS WHOLE PERIOD OF TIME WHEN WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THE BRONCO WAS IMPROPERLY STORED WITHOUT THE APPROPRIATE HOLD AND THEN WHEN IT WAS IMPROPERLY STORED THAT SOME BAD AND UNFORTUNATE THINGS HAPPENED WITH THE EVIDENCE HAVING BEEN LOST.NOW, YOU WILL SEE BETWEEN THIS PERIOD OF JUNE 15, THAT IS THE DATE THAT MERAZ GOT INSIDE WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT TO VIERTEL'S, AND AUGUST 26TH, DID NOT OBSERVE THE SPECIAL CARE RULE TO PRESERVE THE INTEGRITY OF BIOLOGICAL AND TRACE EVIDENCE.WE THINK THERE WILL BE TESTIMONY THAT THIS VEHICLE -- POSSIBLE FOR THIS VEHICLE, FOR ANY NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO GET IN AND OUT OF THAT VEHICLE AND THERE WAS NOT THE HOLD ON IT THAT IT HAD IN THE PRINT SHED, THEN LO AND BEHOLD ON AUGUST 26TH, DURING THE PERIOD OF AUGUST 26, 1994, AND SEPTEMBER 1ST, 1994, THERE WAS, DONE BY THE PROSECUTION, AN EXTENSIVE SEARCH OF THE BRONCO FOR BIOLOGICAL AND TRACE EVIDENCE AND THEY WENT BACK LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE TO USE DURING THIS TRIAL.YOU CAN SEE THIS IS FOR A VEHICLE THAT HAD BEEN TOWED THERE ON JUNE 15, SO WHAT IS THAT? TWO MONTHS PLUS? ALMOST TWO AND A HALF MONTHS.GO BACK. NOW, THEY ARE LOOKING FOR EXTENSIVE SEARCH FOR BIOLOGICAL AND TRACE EVIDENCE. THIS IS A VEHICLE THAT WE KNOW HAS BEEN BASICALLY IMPROPERLY STORED, THERE HAS BEEN AT LEAST ONE BURGLARY OR TRESPASS, AND MAYBE TWO, IF MR. MERAZ IS BELIEVED, YET THEY THEN GO BACK AND SEEK TO GET OUT OF THERE, AND THIS GOES INTO WHAT I HAVE TRIED TO DESCRIBE FOR YOU THERE, THE GRAPHIC OF THE INTEGRITY OF THE EVIDENCE, WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT EVIDENCE, WHERE IT GOES BEFORE IT GETS TO YOU AND WHO HAS HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTAMINATE IT OR COMPROMISE IT OR IN ANY WAY CORRUPT IT.THAT LEADS US TO THE POINT OF THIS INTEGRITY OF EVIDENCE BEING CONTAMINATED, COMPROMISED AND CORRUPTED, AND WE THINK THAT THE SAGA OF THE BRONCO ILLUSTRATES THIS CONCEPT OF THE EVIDENCE BEING CONTAMINATED, COMPROMISED AND CORRUPTED.THANK YOU.NOW -- WE WILL NOW WITH YOUR PERMISSION TURN OUR ATTENTION NOW TO THIS WHOLE CONCEPT OF THE DISCUSSION OF DNA EVIDENCE AND THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT.I SUPPOSE THAT THERE IS A SAYING THAT YOU HAVE GARBAGE IN, YOU GET GARBAGE OUT, AND WE HAVE SEVERAL CHARTS THAT WE THINK WILL BE ILLUSTRATIVE OF THIS WHOLE CONCEPT OF DNA EVIDENCE AND WHAT IT ACTUALLY IS.MR.

IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND CRIME LABS HAVE TRIED TO TRANSFER THIS DNA TEST THAT HAS BEEN USED FOR RESEARCH AND MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS AND APPLY IT TO CRIME SCENE SAMPLES.WE EXPECT ALL OF YOU WILL HEAR IN THE COURSE OF THIS, THE EVIDENCE, THIS TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGY HAS NOT BEEN SIMPLE OR EASY, AND SO I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU IN THE COURSE OF MY OPENING STATEMENT NOW SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DNA TESTING FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES AND FORENSIC DNA TESTING ON CRIME SCENE SAMPLES.REMEMBERING AS WE -- IN THE GRAPHIC, THAT ALL EVIDENCE PASSES THROUGH FIRST THE LAPD'S HANDS.

DOUGLAS HAS GOTTEN AHEAD OF ME JUST A LITTLE BIT.LET'S GO BACK TO THE SMALL AMOUNTS OF DNA FOR ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES TO ILLUSTRATE THIS FOR YOU. THIS IS A CHART THAT IS ENTITLED ""SMALL AMOUNTS OF DNA FROM SPECKS OF BLOOD,"" AND WHAT WE HAVE IS A REGULAR SIZE PENNY HERE AT THE FAR LEFT, AND I WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO COMPROMISE -- STRIKE THAT.I WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO COMPARE A REGULAR SIZE PENNY WITH 20 NANOGRAMS OF DNA AND THAT AMOUNTS TO -- THOSE OF YOU WHO CAN SEE VERY WELL, I AM POINTING TO IT, ALMOST LIKE A PIN PRICK, 20 NANOGRAMS.MUCH OF THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE YOU WILL BE ASKED TO MAKE DECISIONS REGARDING IS ONE/TENTH OF THAT AMOUNT, ONE/TENTH OF THE 20 NANOGRAMS OR TWO NANOGRAMS, AN AMOUNT SO SMALL THAT YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE IT.THAT IS THE WHAT -- WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DEMONSTRATE WITH THIS CHART.

IF I SNEEZED OR IF ANY SALIVA CAME OUT OR IF I SCRATCH MY HAIR AND ANY DANDRUFF WAS THERE OR IF I TOUCH THIS AND I HAD ANY BLOOD ON MY FINGER OR A SPLINTER THERE, IF MISS CLARK DID LIKEWISE, IF MR. DARDEN DID LIKEWISE, THEN OUR DNA WOULD BE ON THIS AREA.AND IF I TOOK A HANDKERCHIEF OUT AND WIPED THIS, THIS IS WHAT THEY DO IN LABS, THAT WOULD PICK UP THE VARIOUS DNA THAT IS HERE. YOU CAN'T SEE IT, THAT IS HOW SMALL IT IS UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES.SO THAT GIVES YOU AN IDEA. IF WE WERE TO WIPE IT ACROSS HERE, OUR HANDKERCHIEF COULD NOW BE TAKEN TO THE LAB AND ALLEGEDLY TAKEN. IN FACT, SOME MEDICAL LABS DO IN FACT DO THIS AND IT IS DONE IN A LAB TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS ANY CONTAMINATION. THAT IS HOW THEY TEST IT TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY CONTAMINATION.IF YOU ARE TRYING TO SEE IF SOMEONE IS GOING TO BE COMPATIBLE FOR A PARTICULAR ORGAN TRANSPLANT, THEY CHECK TO SEE, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SEE THIS.IF I HAD BEEN THE ONLY ONE HERE, YOU MIGHT EXPECT TO FIND ONLY MY DNA, BUT IF MR. DARDEN AND MISS CLARK WERE HERE, YOU MIGHT EXPECT TO FIND THEIR DNA. IF MR. VANNATTER HERE SNEEZED, YOU MIGHT FIND HIS DNA, SO THERE IS ALL KIND OF WAYS IN WHICH WE HAVE THIS POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION.AND ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE TEST IS THAT IT CANNOT TELL ONE PERSON'S DNA FROM ANOTHER. THIS IS WHAT WE CALL -- AND I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL BE A MIXED SAMPLE. THERE IS QUITE A CONTROVERSY, WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW, ABOUT WHETHER SMALL MIXED SAMPLES CAN BE TESTED RELIABLY EVEN IF EVERYTHING ELSE IS DONE PROPERLY AND THERE IS NO CONTAMINATION, SO IF YOU ADD CONTAMINATION TO IT, THEN YOU CAN SEE WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE.NOW, TO GIVE YOU A PERSPECTIVE -- THIS BOARD THAT I'M NOW GOING TO REFER TO IS THE SO-CALLED DNA TESTING TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER BOARD. WHAT WE WANT TO DEMONSTRATE HERE IS YOU WILL RECALL I SAID THAT OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST FIVE YEARS WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO HERE IS TO TRANSFER FROM NO MATTER WHAT WE USE IN MEDICAL RESEARCH AND TO EXCLUDE SUSPECTS PRIMARILY TO THE FIELD TO FORENSICS, TO CRIME SCENES, TO TRY AND MAKE IT WORK IN THAT SETTING.THIS IS, AS I INDICATED TO YOU LAST WEEK, CYBERSPACE OR 21ST CENTURY TECHNOLOGY, AND I THINK YOU WILL FIND THE EVIDENCE WILL BE THAT THE COLLECTION PROCEDURES ARE 19TH CENTURY OR COVERED WAGON COLLECTION PROCEDURES AND THAT IS WHY IT IS SUCH A PROBLEM.AND SO IF YOU LOOKED AT THIS MEDICAL RESEARCH AREA, IN GENERAL YOU COULD EXPECT THAT IN THE MEDICAL FIELD THAT THERE ARE CLEAN SAMPLES, MORE THAN LIKELY IN A CLEAN MEDICAL LAB, THE BLOOD IS CAREFULLY TAKEN UNDER ANTISEPTIC CONDITIONS IN HOSPITALS, AND IN A FORENSIC SETTING DNA TESTING IS DONE BY DEFINITION GENERALLY AND DIRTY SAMPLES ARE TAKEN FROM CRIME SCENES, FROM SIDEWALKS, FROM CARPETS AND THEY ARE EXPOSED TO ALL SORT OF CONTAMINATION, THAT THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT SOURCES, THAT THESE -- AS YOU KNOW ALREADY, THESE ARE MINUTE SPECKS OF BLOOD, THERE MAY BE SALIVA, THERE MAY BE SKIN, CELLS, DANDRUFF, AS I INDICATED TO YOU, EVEN A SPRAY OF A SNEEZE CAN CONTAMINATE THE FORENSIC SAMPLE.SO WHAT I WANT TO DO IN THIS SAMPLE, WE HAVE THESE CHARTS HERE, IS THAT IN COMPARING THE MEDICAL RESEARCH, COMPARE THE MEDICAL RESEARCH WITH THE FORENSIC AND SEE WHICH ONE IS MORE LIKELY TO BE RELIABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.WELL, I THINK THAT THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT AS OPPOSED TO THE CLEAN SAMPLE AND THE DIRTY SAMPLES, IN THIS INSTANCE THE CLEAN SAMPLE IN THE MEDICAL LAB WILL BE FAR MORE RELIABLE, SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN RELY UPON.THE NEXT AREA WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT IS GENERALLY IN A MEDICAL LAB YOU HAVE A GENEROUS SAMPLE SIZE, THE DOCTOR CAN HAVE WHATEVER SAMPLE SIZE HE USUALLY WANTS OR NEEDS.IN FORENSICS THE SAMPLE COMES GENERALLY IN VERY, VERY LIMITED MINUTE AMOUNTS AND IN WORKING WITH SUCH SMALL AMOUNTS OFTEN THE TEST CAN ONLY BE DONE ONCE.AND OF COURSE WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT IS -- IT IS HARDER TO PRODUCE RELIABLE RESULTS UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES.IN FACT, YOU WILL HEAR WE THINK IN THIS CASE, THAT MOST OF THE IMPORTANT DNA TESTS PERFORMED BY THE PROSECUTION WERE DONE WITH AMOUNTS OF DNA THAT WERE ACTUALLY BELOW THE PREFERRED AMOUNTS FOR RELIABLE TESTING.SO IF YOU TALK ABOUT THE MEDICAL RESEARCH LABS HAVING A GENEROUS SAMPLE SIZE AND THEN IN THE FORENSICS AREA HAVING MINUSCULE SAMPLE SIZE, AGAIN YOU CAN SEE THERE IS A HIGHER RISK OF CONTAMINATION IN THE MINUSCULE SAMPLE SIZE AND THAT BRINGS US DOWN TO THE UNMIXED SAMPLE FROM KNOWN SOURCES.AS YOU KNOW, AND MISS CLARK ALLUDED TO THIS IN HER STATEMENT, IN A MEDICAL SETTING YOU HAVE SAMPLES THAT YOU KNOW. IF YOU HAVE A LADY WHO IS GOING TO HAVE AMNIOCENTESIS, YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS. IF YOU HAVE A PERSON WHO IS GOING TO GIVE SOMEBODY ELSE A KIDNEY, YOU KNOW WHO THEY ARE, SO YOU HAVE KNOWN SOURCES THAT YOU ARE DEALING WITH, AND I THINK THAT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE, I THINK YOU WILL SEE, DURING THE COURSE OF THE TESTIMONY.IN MEDICAL TESTING WE TAKE THESE UNMIXED SAMPLES FROM KNOWN PERSONS AND IN FORENSICS WE TAKE THESE SAMPLES IN VARYING AMOUNTS FROM UNKNOWN PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHO HAS WALKED OUT THERE, WHO HAS WALKED, WHO HAS SNEEZED, WHO HAS BLED, WHO HAS SCRATCHED THEIR HEAD. YOU DON'T KNOW OVER A PERIOD OF TIME.WE EXPECT YOU WILL HEAR IN THIS AREA THAT THE NEW FORMS OF DNA TESTING USED BY THE PROSECUTION IN THIS CASE ARE JUST NOT RELIABLE ENOUGH WHEN USING AND ANALYZING MIXTURES FROM UNKNOWN SOURCES AND THE KEY HERE BEING MIXED SAMPLES FROM UNKNOWN SOURCES.SO AGAIN, ONCE AGAIN ON FORENSICS, IN THE HIGHER RISK OF CONTAMINATION, THEN IN THE LAB, IN THE MEDICAL RESEARCH AREA, THERE IS GENERALLY MINIMAL HANDLING. THIS IS FAIRLY CLEAR AND STRAIGHTFORWARD. LESS HANDLING THAN AT THE SCENE WHERE YOU HAVE SOMEONE GOING OUT TRYING TO COLLECT SOMETHING.CONTRARY, AS I SAID, TO WHAT THE PROSECUTOR TOLD YOU LAST WEEK, THE EVIDENCE WILL BE IT IS NOT AS SIMPLE AS WIPING UP A SPILL IN YOUR KITCHEN. THIS TECHNOLOGY IS SO SENSITIVE, IT IS NOT THAT SIMPLE AT ALL. YOU AND I JUST SHOULDN'T GO OUT AND DO THIS. WE CAN DO IT IF WE WANTED TO USE THE SAME TECHNIQUE THEY USE WITH THE LAPD, BUT YOU WILL GET RESULTS THAT ARE ALL UNRELIABLE, SO BETWEEN MINIMAL HANDLING AND MULTIPLE HANDLING YOU CAN SEE AGAIN THAT THERE IS A HIGHER RISK OF CONTAMINATION WITH THE MULTIPLE HANDLING.ERROR RATES BETWEEN KNOWN -- AND THAT IS BECAUSE I THINK YOU WILL HEAR TESTIMONY THAT IN THE MEDICAL LABS THEY SUBJECT THEIR RESULTS AND THINGS TO TESTS.I MENTIONED THE WIPE TEST. IN LABS THEY DO THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT CONTAMINATION IN THE LABS WHEN YOU GO TO THE DOCTOR. YOU WANT TO HAVE THE DOCTOR MAKE SURE HIS LAB IS CONTAMINATION FREE AS NEAR AS POSSIBLE. THAT BRINGS ABOUT CONFIDENCE AND THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE DONE, A WHOLE INDUSTRY BASED UPON.TRANSFERRING THIS TECHNOLOGY TO THE FORENSICS AREA, THE ERROR RATES ARE NOT NEARLY AS WELL KNOWN, AS I THINK YOU CAN SEE, SO AGAIN THERE IS A HIGHER RISK OF CONTAMINATION AND ERROR IN THIS AREA ALSO.I THINK YOU WILL FIND THAT IN THE COURSE OF THE TESTIMONY THAT THE LABS HAVE A HIGHER STANDARD FOR DOING DNA TESTING IN MEDICAL LABORATORIES, THEY ARE MUCH STRICTER ON THEMSELVES THAN THE STANDARD THAT FORENSICS AND THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND LABORATORIES ARE USING.AND SO YOU CAN SEE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. IN ONE CASE, WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THESE HIGHER STANDARDS, YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOUR ORGANS WILL BE COMPATIBLE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE AN ORGAN TRANSFER OR OTHER AND THE OTHER YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT SOMEBODY'S FREEDOM, THEIR VIRTUAL LIFE, SO WE ARE GOING TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT UNDER THIS SCENARIO WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE NOT HIGHER CLINICAL LAB STANDARDS THAN YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT SOMEBODY AT THE HOSPITAL THAN YOU ARE WHEN YOU ARE CONCERNED WITH SOMEBODY ON TRIAL FOR THEIR VERY LIFE.GIVEN THE LOWER STANDARDS AND THE LACK OF TESTING AGAIN IN THIS AREA, AGAIN IN THIS AREA, IN FORENSICS, THERE IS A HIGHER RISK OF CONTAMINATION AND ERROR.I MENTIONED THIS EARLIER, BUT IN THE LABS THERE IS THIS RIGOROUS PROFICIENCY TESTING, AND OF COURSE I THINK YOU WILL FIND, AND THE TESTIMONY WILL BE, THAT IN FORENSICS VERY RARELY DO THEY DO ANY BLIND TESTING. NO OUTSIDE AGENCIES. THEY GIVE THEMSELVES EASY TESTS AND ALMOST NEVER TAKE BLIND EXTERNAL PROFICIENCY TESTS, AND THAT HAS A REAL BEARING ON THE OVERALL PROFICIENCY HERE.AND SO AGAIN, I THINK YOU WILL FIND THERE IS A HIGHER RISK OF CONTAMINATION AND ERROR IN THE FORENSICS AREA AGAIN.AND FINALLY, WITH REGARD TO STATISTICAL CONTROVERSY IN THIS AREA, IN MEDICAL TESTING, USUALLY YOU ARE JUST TRYING TO SEE IF SOMEONE HAS INHERITED A COPY OF THE DISEASED GENE FROM THEIR PARENT OR WHATEVER, HAS THE CORRECT GENETIC TYPES FOR TRANSPLANTATION OF AN ORGAN, HAS BEEN INFECTED WITH A HARMFUL BACTERIA OR VIRUS. THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR, AND THERE IS NO ELABORATE STATISTICAL ESTIMATES ARE NEEDED TO GET RELIABLE TEST RESULTS FOR THAT.IN FORENSICS WE THINK YOU WILL HEAR TESTIMONY THAT THERE IS A BITTER AND COMPLICATED STATISTICAL CONTROVERSY REGARDING THIS ENTIRE AREA, DNA, SPECIFICALLY PCR, ABOUT A DNA MATCH AND WHAT A MATCH MEANS.AND WHILE WE ARE ABOUT IT, I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW, WHEN YOU HEAR THE PROSECUTOR TALKING ABOUT IT IS A MATCH, IT IS A MATCH, IT IS A MATCH, WHAT SHE REALLY MEANS TO SAY IS THAT IT IS CONSISTENT WITH -- THESE ARE NOT FINGERPRINTS -- CONSISTENT WITH SOMEONE ELSE'S GENOTYPE OR WITH THEIR BLOOD TYPE.SO WITH REGARD TO THIS WHOLE AREA OF STATISTICAL CONTROVERSY, AGAIN THE FORENSICS AREA, THE HIGHER RISK OF CONTAMINATION ERROR IN THIS AREA AGAIN.SO AS YOU LOOK AT THIS -- THIS CHART, YOU LOOK AT BLOOD ON BOTH SIDES OF THAT, YOU CAN SEE CLEARLY, AND I EXPECT THE EVIDENCE TO BE THAT BECAUSE OF THE DIRTY SAMPLES, THE MINUSCULE SAMPLE SIZE, THE MIXED SAMPLE FROM UNKNOWN SOURCES, THE MULTIPLE HANDLING, THE ERROR RATES NOT WELL-KNOWN, THE LOW LAB STANDARDS, THE EASY PROFICIENCY TESTING, AND THE MAJOR STATISTICAL CONTROVERSY, THAT IN ALL THOSE AREAS IN SEEKING TO TRANSFER THIS TECHNOLOGY TO FORENSICS IS FRAUGHT WITH ALL KIND OF PROBLEMS AND THIS IS A MUCH HIGHER RISK OF CONTAMINATION AND ERROR.NOW, WE EXPECT THAT DURING THIS HEARING YOU WILL HEAR SOME ASTRONOMICAL NUMBERS PRESENTED REGARDING THE DNA TEST RESULTS, AND THESE NUMBERS ARE PART OF WHAT I WAS TELLING YOU, THE STATISTICAL CONTROVERSY, WHETHER OR NOT THESE ARE ACCEPTED IN THE SCIENCE AND THESE NUMBERS ALSO ONLY ADDRESS GENE FREQUENCIES.THESE ARE NOT FINGERPRINTS. AND THE NUMBERS THAT YOU WILL HEAR, IF YOU HEAR THEM IN THIS CASE, HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ISSUE OF CONTAMINATION THAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. THEY DO NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE ISSUE OF LABORATORY ERRORS. THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE ISSUE OF TAMPERING, WHETHER THE SAMPLE WAS TAMPERED WITH, AND THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH OTHER IMPORTANT DNA ISSUES WHICH YOU WILL HEAR ABOUT IN THE COURSE OF THIS CASE.SPECIFICALLY UNDER THE DNA TESTING ASPECT, WE THINK THAT YOU WILL HEAR TESTIMONY IN THIS CASE ABOUT POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION, SO-CALLED PCR TESTING, AND I THINK YOU WILL FIND OUT IN HERE THAT THE VERY BEST MEDICAL AND RESEARCH LABS THAT DO PCR HAVE CONTAMINATION PROBLEMS.AND AS I MENTIONED TO YOU LAST WEEK, I THINK THAT YOU WILL HEAR, THAT THIS IS AN AREA THAT PRESENTS A REAL PROBLEM.WE EXPECT DURING THE COURSE OF OUR EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE TO SHOW THAT FROM THEIR OWN STUDIES THE LAPD'S LABORATORY IS A CESSPOOL OF CONTAMINATION. LOOKING AT THEIR OWN RECORDS AND THE TESTS THEY HAVE RUN WE WILL DEMONSTRATE FOR YOU WHAT THOSE RECORDS SHOW.WE EXPECT THEN IN THIS ENTIRE AREA THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THE CARELESS, SLIPSHOD NEGLIGENT COLLECTION, HANDLING AND PROCESSING OF SAMPLES BY BASICALLY POORLY TRAINED PERSONNEL FROM LAPD HAS CONTAMINATED, COMPROMISED AND CORRUPTED THE DNA EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE.AND YOUR HONOR, THIS MAY BE A GOOD SPOT, UNLESS YOU WANT ME TO GO FURTHER.

#MR. COCHRAN: ,"YES, I DO, YOUR HONOR. THANK YOU VERY KINDLY.OPENING STATEMENT (RESUMED)BY MR. COCHRAN:JUDGE ITO AND COUNSEL, GANG, GOOD AFTERNOON, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.I CAN MAKE A PROMISE TO YOU AT THIS TIME THAT I WILL FINISH THIS OPENING STATEMENT THIS AFTERNOON. BARRING ANY UNFORESEEN CALAMITIES, WE'LL BE FINISHED THIS AFTERNOON WITH THE OPENING STATEMENT.THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE, AND I ASK YOU AGAIN TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND.JUST BEFORE WE CONCLUDED LUNCH, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF DNA. AND WE STILL HAVE SOME MORE DNA TO TALK ABOUT.I HAVE TWO CHARTS NOW I WANT TO DISCUSS WITH YOU BRIEFLY. THEY'RE LABELED FOR THE RECORD, ""PCR AMPLIFICATION CHARTS."" AND WE'RE SEEKING TO EXPLAIN HOW THIS CONCEPT WORKS, THE POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION OR PCR. THIS TECHNOLOGY I'VE BEEN TALKING TO YOU ABOUT IS A FACET OF DNA TECHNOLOGY.PCR TESTS TAKE THESE VERY, VERY SMALL SAMPLES THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT -- AND NOW YOU'VE SEEN SOME OF WHICH YOU CAN NOT EVEN SEE -- AND THEY ARE AMPLIFIED UP, KIND OF A MOLECULAR XEROXING IF YOU WILL. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DEMONSTRATE HERE.WE EXPECT THE EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT SCIENTISTS ARE NOT YET ABLE TO ACTUALLY EXAMINE THE SMALL AMOUNT OF DNA CONTAINED IN MINUTE SPECKS OF BLOOD. THEY MUST FIRST AMPLIFY THE DNA SO THERE'S ENOUGH OF IT TO EXAMINE.AMPLIFICATION OR AMPLIFYING DNA, AS I SAID, IS LIKE MOLECULAR XEROXING. YOU START WITH A SMALL AMOUNT OF DNA AND THEY GO THROUGH THESE VARIOUS CYCLES. EACH CYCLE DOUBLES THE AMOUNT OF DNA, AND THEY DO THIS 32 TIMES, THE EVIDENCE WILL BE, BEFORE THEY HAVE ENOUGH DNA TO EXAMINE.NOW, THIS FIRST CHART SHOWS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE A SINGLE PIECE OF DNA THAT IS THEN AMPLIFIED OR DOUBLED 32 TIMES. AND THEN IT GOES FROM THIS ONE FRAGMENT THAT YOU MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EVEN SEE TO OVER FOUR BILLION FRAGMENTS, AS IS INDICATED ON THE PARTICULAR CHART.THAT IS THE MOLECULAR XEROXING MADE AS -- HOPEFULLY AS CLEAR AS WE CAN MAKE IT IN LIGHT OF WHAT WE EXPECT THE TESTIMONY TO BE.MR. DOUGLAS, WILL YOU MOVE -- WHAT'S THE NUMBER OF THAT CHART, MR. DOUGLAS?
","JANUARY 30, 1995 ",9:10 A.M.
#MR. DOUGLAS: ,"FOR THE RECORD, YOUR HONOR, THIS WAS NO. 208 AND THE NEXT IS 209.
","JANUARY 30, 1995 ",9:10 A.M.
#MR. COCHRAN: ,"NOW, REFERRING AND DIRECTING YOUR ATTENTION TO NO. 209, WHICH IS AN AMPLIFICATION OF FOUR FRAGMENTS, NOW, THIS CHART SEEKS TO ILLUSTRATE FOR YOU WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE MAY BE A MIXTURE OF DNA IN THE SAMPLE, WHERE IT'S TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES -- AND YOU HEARD ME THIS MORNING TALK ABOUT THE WIPE TEST WITH THE HANDKERCHIEF ON THIS PARTICULAR PODIUM.THIS CHART SHOWS FOUR DIFFERENT FRAGMENTS OF DNA AT THE START. AND AFTER THIS MIXTURE, LIKE WE DID IN THE PREVIOUS CHART, IS AMPLIFIED UP, THERE WILL NOW BE OVER -- THE BOTTOM SHOULD BE 16 BILLION OR 17 BILLION FRAGMENTS.EXTRA FRAGMENTS OF DNA, THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW, COULD GET INTO THE SAMPLE IN ANY NUMBER OF WAYS, AND THAT'S ONE OF THE VICES OF THIS PARTICULAR SYSTEM AND ITS RELIABILITY; FROM SOMEONE COUGHING ON THE EVIDENCE, FROM FLECKS OF BLOOD WHICH MAY COME FROM ONE SAMPLE BEING PASSED ON TO ANOTHER SAMPLE, FROM SPECKS OF BLOOD THAT STICK TO A PAIR OF TWEEZERS IF THE TECHNICIAN IS USING THOSE OR SCISSORS, FROM SOMEONE SHEDDING DEAD SKIN CELLS ON TO THE EVIDENCE, FROM DANDRUFF, FROM ANY NUMBER OF THINGS.SO THE PROBLEM BECOMES, WHEN ONE SEEKS TO -- WHEN ONE HAS MORE THAN ONE SAMPLE AND THE AMPLIFICATION GETS INTO THE BILLIONS, WE STILL HAVE THIS SAME PROBLEM AS YOU LOOK AT THAT.THESE CHARTS -- WE EXPECT TO HAVE TESTIMONY FROM THE EXPERTS TO ADDRESS THESE CHARTS. WE HOPEFULLY USED THESE TODAY TO MAKE THIS PROCESS A LITTLE CLEARER TO YOU OF HOW THE PCR IS AMPLIFIED UP TRYING TO GET SOME RESULTS.AND EVEN WHEN YOU GET THE RESULTS, AS I INDICATED THIS MORNING, A MATCH DOESN'T MEAN LIKE A FINGERPRINT. IT MEANS CONSISTENT WITH GENERALLY, AND THERE CAN BE -- IF THE CONTAMINATION GETS IN THERE, THEN YOU CAN'T TELL ONE PERSON'S DNA FROM THE OTHER.AND WE CAN MOVE ON TO THE NEXT CHART.NOW, IN THIS CASE, TRYING TO CONCLUDE OUR DISCUSSION OF DNA SO EVERYBODY CAN WAKE UP AGAIN AND BE ALIVE AGAIN, THIS -- YOU HEARD A LOT ABOUT DNA AND YOU WILL HEAR A LOT ABOUT DNA EVIDENCE. THE PROSECUTION WILL UNDOUBTEDLY PRODUCE SOME OF THESE TECHNICIANS WHO COME IN FROM THE CRIME LAB WHO PERFORMED THE VARIOUS TESTS.AND YOU WILL RECALL THAT ON THIS PARTICULAR HIGH-PROFILE CASE, THEY DESIGNATED AS THE OFFICER IN CHARGE A MISS MAZZOLA, WHO IS A TRAINEE, WHICH THIS WAS ONLY HER THIRD CRIME SCENE. SHE WAS SUPERVISED BY A MR. FONG, WHO WAS HER SUPERVISOR THAT DAY.AND WE EXPECT THEIR TECHNICIANS WILL COME IN, TELL YOU WHAT THEY DID, THE VARIOUS TESTS THEY CONDUCTED AND CONCLUSIONS WHICH THEY HAVE DRAWN FROM THE TESTS.WE EXPECT TO PRESENT TESTIMONY HOWEVER SOMEWHAT CONTRARY, INCLUDING SOME OF THE PEOPLE I TOLD YOU ABOUT EARLIER, AND WE EXPECT THAT THE PEOPLE WE CALL WILL TELL YOU BASED UPON THEIR OBSERVATION AND THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FIELD WHICH OF THESE TESTS RESULTS ARE RELIABLE AND WHICH ONES AREN'T GIVEN WHAT THE TECHNICIANS WILL TELL YOU THAT THEY DID.NOW, IN SUMMARY WITH REGARD TO THE DNA, WE WILL LOOK AT EACH ITEM, HOPEFULLY HAVE TESTIMONY REGARDING EACH ITEM, HOPEFULLY HAVE SOME TESTIMONY REGARDING WHICH ITEMS ARE RELIABLE, ARE NOT RELIABLE AND THEN GIVE YOU EVIDENCE BY WHICH YOU CAN MAKE A FINAL DECISION.YOU WILL RECALL I BELIEVE THAT MISS CLARK IN HER OPENING STATEMENT SAID THAT BLOOD CONSISTENT WITH NICOLE BROWN AND RON GOLDMAN WAS FOUND ON THE GLOVE THAT THIS DETECTIVE FUHRMAN WE TALKED ABOUT CLAIMS TO HAVE FOUND BEHIND MR. SIMPSON'S HOME. THAT GLOVE WILL BE UNDOUBTEDLY, THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW, ONE OF THE MOST HOTLY DISPUTED ITEMS IN THIS CASE.WHERE THE GLOVE WAS, HOW IT GOT THERE, WHERE IT CAME FROM WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES. IN ADDITION TO THAT, THERE WILL BE A MAJOR DISPUTE IN CERTAIN OTHER AREAS.I THINK YOU WILL HEAR A LOT OF TESTIMONY ABOUT THIS SO-CALLED BLOOD FOUND IN THE BRONCO. YOU REMEMBER THE BRONCO TIME LINE.YOU WILL HEAR A LOT OF TESTIMONY ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE PROSECUTION'S CONTENTION THAT BLOOD CONSISTENT WITH -- NOT THEIR BLOOD, BUT CONSISTENT WITH GOLDMAN AND NICOLE FOUND INSIDE -- NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON INSIDE THE BRONCO, WHETHER OR NOT THIS FINDING IS TRUSTWORTHY.WE EXPECT THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THE POLICE TECHNICIANS WOULD USE UNRELIABLE PROCEDURES IN COLLECTING THIS, THEY MADE FUNDAMENTAL ERRORS IN CONDUCTING THESE TESTS AND THEN MISINTERPRETED THEIR OWN FINDINGS AS I INDICATED TO YOU EARLIER, THAT THE STAINS THAT THEY THINK ARE CONSISTENT WITH GOLDMAN AND NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON CONTAIN TINY AMOUNTS OF DNA, SO LITTLE, THEY CAN BARELY BE DETECTED. THIS DNA COULD ONLY BE FOUND USING THIS SUPER-SENSITIVE PROCEDURE WE TALKED ABOUT WHERE EVEN A SNEEZE COULD CONTAMINATE IT.SO EVEN IF THE TEST RESULTS WERE RIGHT, WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THE DNA COULD BE FROM A TINY AMOUNT OF CONTAMINATING DNA FROM THE CRIME SCENE FROM ANOTHER PERSON.FINALLY, IN THAT CONNECTION, WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THE DNA RESULTS THAT SUPPOSEDLY PUT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON AND RON GOLDMAN IN THE BRONCO ARE NOT LIKE A FINGERPRINT AND A MATCH DOESN'T MEAN THAT. THEY DETECT CHARACTERISTICS IN THE DNA THAT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE, NOT CHARACTERISTICS THAT ARE UNIQUE TO ONE PARTICULAR PERSON.NOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING OTHER THAN DNA FOR A MOMENT.WHEN MR. SIMPSON CAME BACK FROM CHICAGO, I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL BE THAT HE CAME HOME IMMEDIATELY. HE CAME BACK VOLUNTARILY AFTER HEARING ABOUT HIS EX-WIFE'S DEATH. YOU HAVE HEARD SOME INDICATION ABOUT HIS DEMEANOR.ON HIS WAY BACK, THAT HE WENT -- CAME HOME, HE WAS ASKED BY THE POLICE TO COME DOWNTOWN, THAT HE WENT DOWNTOWN, THAT -- WITHOUT GIVING YOU WHAT THE STATEMENT WAS -- THAT HE COOPERATED FULLY AND THAT HE GAVE THE POLICE A STATEMENT, PERHAPS SOME 33 MINUTES, WHICH STATEMENT IS TAPE-RECORDED, THAT THE TWO DETECTIVES WHO INTERVIEWED HIM AT THE TIME WERE DETECTIVES LANGE AND VANNATTER.HE ANSWERED ALL THEIR QUESTIONS. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THAT INTERVIEW, THEY ASKED FOR A BLOOD SAMPLE. MR. SIMPSON WAS ONLY TOO PLEASED OR COOPERATIVE TO GO AND GIVE A BLOOD SAMPLE AT THAT TIME.AND IF I MIGHT STEP OVER A LITTLE CLOSER, THIS NEXT CHART --MR. DOUGLAS, WHAT IS THIS CHART?
","JANUARY 30, 1995 ",9:10 A.M.
#MR. DOUGLAS: ,"NO. 205.
","JANUARY 30, 1995 ",9:10 A.M.
#MR. COCHRAN: ,"THIS CHART HOPEFULLY WILL GRAPHICALLY ILLUSTRATE WHAT TOOK PLACE.REFERRING TO 205, WE HAVE PARKER CENTER. THIS IS LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT HEADQUARTERS DOWN AT 150 NORTH LOS ANGELES. THIS IS THE BUILDING IN WHICH MR. SIMPSON GAVE THIS STATEMENT TO THE TWO LEAD DETECTIVES FROM ROBBERY/HOMICIDE (INDICATING).HE WAS QUESTIONED AND HE ANSWERED THEIR QUESTIONS. THEREAFTER -- AND THAT'S THE BUILDING DEPICTED -- THERE'S THE LITTLE YELLOW CIRCLE DEPICTED THERE (INDICATING).THEREAFTER, THEY ASKED MR. SIMPSON TO GIVE SOME BLOOD. A TECHNICIAN THEN DREW SOME BLOOD FROM HIS ARM. WE THINK, ACCORDING TO THE TESTIMONY, IT WAS APPROXIMATELY EIGHT MILLILITERS OF BLOOD. THE TESTIMONY WAS BETWEEN 7.9 AND 8.1, WHICH I THINK IS EIGHT MILLILITERS OF BLOOD.NOW, WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW UNDER NORMAL POLICE PROCEDURES, IF THEY'D BEEN FOLLOWING THEIR OWN PROCEDURES, WHEN THE DETECTIVES HAD THIS BLOOD IN A VIAL, CERTAINLY MR. SIMPSON'S BLOOD AT THAT TIME, THEY WOULD HAVE TAKEN IT OVER, ABOUT A THREE-MINUTE -- A VERY SHORT DRIVE AND BOOK IT AT A PLACE CALLED PIPER TECH.YOU WILL HEAR EVIDENCE ABOUT WHERE THEY BOOK THIS KIND OF EVIDENCE, WHERE THE REFRIGERATORS ARE AND THAT SORT OF THING, BOOK IT TO PRESERVE IT. YOU WILL HEAR THE IMPORTANCE OF PRESERVING THAT BLOOD.WE THINK THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE WILL SHOW THAT THE DETECTIVES DIDN'T TAKE THE BLOOD FROM SIMPSON AT ABOUT 2:30 ON JANUARY -- ON JUNE 13TH, 1994. THEY DIDN'T GO THIS VERY SHORT DISTANCE TO PIPER TECH AND BOOK IT.FOR SOME REASON, THEY CAME ALL THE WAY -- I GUESS THIS IS SOME 20 MILES OR SO -- FROM DOWNTOWN L.A. WITH THE BLOOD ON THEIR PERSON IN THIS VIAL, CAME ALL THE WAY OUT HERE TO THIS AREA CALLED BRENTWOOD, THE HOME OF O.J. SIMPSON, 360 NORTH ROCKINGHAM AVENUE.AND WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW DETECTIVE VANNATTER, WHO HAD THIS BLOOD ON HIS PERSON, INSTEAD OF BOOKING IT AT PIPER TECH WHERE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN, CARRIED THIS BLOOD AROUND FROM 2:30 UNTIL PERHAPS 5:20 IN THE AFTERNOON ON JUNE 13TH, 1994, WENT BACK TO MR. O.J. SIMPSON'S HOME.AND THERE, WE EXPECT THERE WILL BE SOME TESTIMONY THE BLOOD VIAL HE HAD BEEN CARRYING AROUND APPARENTLY IN HIS POCKET, HE THEN TURNED OVER TO MR. FONG, WHO IS A SUPERVISOR OF THIS OFFICER IN CHARGE, THE TRAINEE AT THE SCENE. AND THEN YOU WILL HEAR SOME INTERESTING TESTIMONY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WITH THAT BLOOD.THE BLOOD IS SUPPOSED TO BE NO. 17, BUT IT GETS BOOKED AS NO. 18 AT SOME POINT. NO. 18 YOU'RE GOING TO FIND IS A PAIR OF SNEAKERS.THAT SAME AFTERNOON, AT ROCKINGHAM, WE THINK YOU WILL HEAR TESTIMONY THAT DETECTIVE VANNATTER'S PARTNER, DETECTIVE LANGE, A MEMBER OF LAPD SOME 25, 27 YEARS, TALKS TO MR. SIMPSON AFTER MR. SIMPSON COMES BACK HOME, AND THEY ASK HIM, ""WHAT SHOES WERE YOU WEARING LAST NIGHT,"" WORDS TO THAT EFFECT, AND THEY PICK UP A PAIR OF REEBOK TENNIS SHOES.AND I THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH WHAT KATO KAELIN HAD SAID HE WAS WEARING I THINK WHEN HE GOES TO MC DONALD'S TO GET THE HAMBURGER.THEY THEN TAKE THESE TENNIS SHOES. THE TENNIS SHOES ARE ULTIMATELY BOOKED AS NO. 18. BUT FOR A WHILE AT LEAST, THE BLOOD IS ALSO NO. 18.DETECTIVE LANGE I THINK WILL TESTIFY THAT HE TAKES THESE TENNIS SHOES AND HE TAKES THEM HOME FOR THE NIGHT. HE DOESN'T GO BACK DOWNTOWN AND BOOK THEM OR WHATEVER. HE TAKES THEM HOME AND BRINGS THEM BACK THE NEXT DAY, WHICH WOULD BE THE 14TH.SO THIS IS MISLABELED, THERE'S CONFUSION AS TO WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS BLOOD AND WHO GETS IT.WE KNOW THAT THE NEXT MORNING, FUNG HAS THE BLOOD DOWNTOWN, AND COLLIN YAMAUCHI, ONE OF THE TECHNICIANS, TAKES ONE MILLILITER OF BLOOD OUT OF THIS PARTICULAR VIAL.SO THIS BLOOD -- THIS IS THE STRANGE SAGA OF THIS BLOOD AND WHY IT WAS CARRIED OUT HERE. WE EXPECT THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW EXACTLY THE EVENTS I JUST TESTIFIED TO OR JUST TOLD YOU ABOUT IN TESTIMONY.MR. DOUGLAS.

#MR. COCHRAN: ,"NOW, WITH REGARD TO EXHIBIT 211, THIS EXHIBIT SEEKS TO DEMONSTRATE FOR YOU AS BEST WE CAN USING THE PROSECUTION'S RECORDS. ALL WE CAN USE ARE THE RECORDS. THESE ARE THEIR RECORDS. THIS IS WRONG MAYBE BECAUSE THE RECORDS ARE WRONG.BUT DEFENDANT'S SAMPLE OFFERED VOLUNTARILY. WE TOLD YOU THAT. THAT IS MR. SIMPSON'S BLOOD. I'VE ALREADY SHARED WITH YOU THAT HE HAD EIGHT MILLILITERS TAKEN ON JUNE 13.WE KNOW THAT THE DETECTIVE WALKS AROUND WITH IT FOR AT LEAST THREE HOURS OR SO BEFORE THE TECHNICIAN EVER GETS IT, ACCORDING TO THE RECORDS AS WE UNDERSTAND. SO YOU START WITH THE EIGHT MILLILITERS.WE KNOW THAT ON JUNE 14TH, I THINK THERE WILL BE TESTIMONY THAT COLLIN YAMAUCHI TOOK FROM FUNG ONE MILLILITER OF MR. SIMPSON'S BLOOD.YOU HAVE TO -- WE'LL HAVE TO SUBTRACT THAT AT SOME POINT.WE KNOW THAT SEVEN DAYS LATER, MR. FLAGHERTY TOOK 1.5 MILLILITERS IN A TUBE, A SMALLER TUBE AS INDICATED HERE, ULTIMATELY RETURNED EIGHT MILLILITERS FROM THIS TUBE. SO WE KNOW THERE WAS .7 MILLILITERS USED OUT OF THE SMALLER TUBE THAT HAD BEEN TAKEN ON THE 21ST.THEN ON JUNE 25TH, COLLIN YAMAUCHI AGAIN PUT SOME BLOOD ON SOME THREADS FOR SOME PURPOSE AND HE USED ONLY .05 MILLILITERS AT THAT POINT ACCORDING TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR EVIDENCE.THEN ON JUNE 27TH, MR. MATHESON, AGAIN, ANOTHER ONE OF THE TECHNICIANS, TOOK .75 MILLILITERS OF MR. SIMPSON'S BLOOD, ALL FROM THE SAME TUBE.AND FINALLY, THE DEFENSE AT SOME POINT WERE GIVEN ONE MILLILITER OF THE BLOOD.AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME BLOOD LEFT IN THE SMALL TUBE AND WE KNOW THAT -- AND A RECENT MEASUREMENT IN JANUARY -- I THINK ON OR ABOUT JANUARY 4TH OF THIS YEAR, THERE WAS 1.8 MILLILITERS LEFT IN THE TUBE PLUS THE EIGHT MILLILITERS RETURNED FROM THE SMALLER TUBE.AND IF YOU SUBTRACT THESE PARTICULAR FIGURES -- AND I'VE DONE THAT -- SUBTRACT THE 1.0, THE .7, THE .05, THE .75, THE 1.0, YOU WILL HAVE 3.50 MILLILITERS OF BLOOD TAKEN. TO THAT, YOU HAVE TO ADD THE 1.8 LEFT AND THE .8 THAT WAS USED THERE OR 2.60. SO IF YOU ADD THE 2.60 TO THE 3.50, YOU WILL GET 6.10 MILLILITERS OF BLOOD.AND SO THIS CHART -- AND PERHAPS MAYBE WILL BE EXPLAINED TO US DURING THE TRIAL -- SHOWS THAT IF YOU STARTED WITH 8.0 MILLILITERS AND YOU USE 6.10 MILLILITERS, IT WOULD BE THEN 1.9 MILLILITERS MISSING ABOVE THE AMOUNT THAT'S LEFT, 1.90 MISSING.AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE WILL BE LOOKING AT IN THIS CASE IS WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT MISSING BLOOD AND WHERE IS IT. PERHAPS THERE ARE SOME RECORDS WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT WILL EXPLAIN THAT. BUT THOSE ARE THE RECORDS AS WE UNDERSTAND IT, THAT THERE WILL BE 1.90 MILLILITERS OF MISSING BLOOD IN THAT CONNECTION.A BIT MORE ABOUT THIS CRIME SCENE AND WHAT HAPPENED.WE THINK YOU WILL SEE AND HEAR FROM THIS TRAINEE MAZZOLA AND WHAT SHE DID AT THAT SCENE, HOW SHE SOUGHT TO COLLECT THESE SAMPLES, DETECTIVE FUNG'S ROLE AT BOTH BUNDY AND AT BOTH -- ROCKINGHAM. I THINK YOU WILL BE ABLE TO THEN MAKE A DETERMINATION ABOUT WHAT TOOK PLACE OUT THERE ON THAT DATE.NOW, ONE OF THE OTHER KEY BITS OF EVIDENCE WE EXPECT IN THIS CASE WILL BE THE SOCKS THAT MISS CLARK TALKED TO YOU ABOUT IN HER OPENING STATEMENT. REMEMBER SHE TALKED ABOUT THE SOCKS?AND I THINK THAT WITH REGARD TO THE SOCKS, I BELIEVE WE HAVE A TIME LINE AND WE ALSO HAVE A GRAPHIC WITH REGARD TO THE SOCKS ALSO.MAY WE HAVE THE GRAPHIC AND THE NUMBER OF THE GRAPHIC?

#MR. COCHRAN: ,"-- OF THESE SOCKS WHICH WERE LOCATED THERE.AND THIS NOW IS JUNE 13TH, THE AFTERNOON HOURS AT THE ROCKINGHAM RESIDENCE, THESE SOCKS ARE LOCATED.NOW, THE TIME LINE I THINK IS HELPFUL TO US AS WE CONSIDER AND LOOK AT THESE SOCKS.AGAIN, THESE SOCKS RECOVERED ON JUNE 13TH. WE TALKED ABOUT THAT. AND THEY'RE EXAMINED ON JUNE 13, AND THERE'S NO MENTION OF BLOOD ON THESE SOCKS ON JUNE 13TH.WE KNOW THAT MICHELE KESTLER, BASICALLY THE SUPERVISOR OF THE LAB OVER THERE AT LAPD, SHOWS THESE SOCKS -- THEY CAN'T REALLY EXAMINE THEM -- TO TWO OF OUR EXPERTS, DRS. MICHAEL BADIN AND DR. BARBARA WOLF. THEY SEE THE SOCKS ON JUNE 24TH. THAT'S WITHIN 11 DAYS OF THE SOCKS HAVING BEEN TAKEN BACK TO THE LAB. IT'S JUNE 24TH.AROUND THIS SAME TIME, I THINK ALSO IN JUNE, MISS MICHELE KESTLER I THINK MAKES SOME OBSERVATIONS OF THESE SOCKS AND AT SOME POINT SEES SOME FIBER OR SOMETHING ON THE SOCKS. SO THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY I BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW TO LOOK AT THESE SOCKS, TO BE ABLE TO OBSERVE THEM ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION.THEN WE THINK THAT ON JUNE 29TH, 1994, THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT KESTLER, MATHESON AND YAMAUCHI DO IN FACT INSPECT THE SOCKS. THAT'S THE THIRD DATE IN THE SAGA OF THE SOCKS.IT'S NOT UNTIL AUGUST 4TH, 1994 THAT ANYBODY IN THE LAPD LAB SEES A BLOODSTAIN ON THESE SOCKS FOR THE FIRST TIME. NOW, THESE ARE THE SAME SOCKS THAT YOU SEE UP HERE THAT ARE PICKED UP ON JUNE 13TH AND SEEN ON THE 13TH, SEEN ON THE 24TH, SEEN ON THE 29TH. BUT YET, IT'S AUGUST 4TH BEFORE A BLOODSTAIN IS SEEN ON THESE SOCKS FOR THE FIRST TIME.AND THAT'S NOT ALL. WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT ON OR ABOUT SEPTEMBER 22ND, 1994, THERE WAS -- WITHOUT TESTING ANY BLAME TO ANYONE -- A FALSE LEAD TO THE PRESS THAT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S DNA HAD BEEN FOUND ON ONE OF THESE SOCKS.THE PROBLEM WITH THAT FALSE LEAK WAS THAT NO DNA TESTS HAD YET BEEN PERFORMED. SO THEY HAD PREDICTED THE RESULTS BEFORE THE SOCKS HAD EVER BEEN TESTED FOR DNA. THEY WERE STILL IN FACT AT THE LAPD LAB WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO THIS.THEN THE SOCKS AFTER THAT LEAK ON THE 22ND I BELIEVE -- AND THAT LEAK WAS BY A LOCAL CHANNEL 4 REPORTER, WHO THEN RECONFIRMED THAT LEAK THE NEXT DAY, ABOUT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S DNA ON THESE SOCKS. THE SOCKS THEN WERE NOT EVEN SENT OUT FOR DNA TESTING UNTIL SEPTEMBER 26TH, SOME FOUR DAYS LATER.THEN OF COURSE, LO AND BEHOLD, ON NOVEMBER 17TH, 1994, THE LAB REPORTS, THEY FIND DNA ON THE SOCKS, NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S DNA ON THE SOCKS, JUST AS THEY HAD PREDICTED IN THIS FALSE LEAK ON SEPTEMBER 22ND. AND OF COURSE, THESE ARE THE SAME SOCKS WHERE NOBODY SAW ANY BLOOD AT ALL UNTIL AUGUST 4TH.AND THAT'S NOT ALL WITH REGARD TO THESE SOCKS. YOU WILL HEAR THAT THROUGHOUT, THERE ARE VERY, VERY SMALL AMOUNTS OF THESE NANOGRAMS THAT YOU SAW ON THE CHART ON THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE. THE NANOGRAMS FOUND ON THESE SOCKS IS MORE THAN 1400 NANOGRAMS, WHICH IS AS MUCH AS ALL THE OTHER BLOOD TESTED IN THIS ENTIRE CASE JUST ON THESE SOCKS.AND SO WE THINK THIS WILL BE -- THE EVIDENCE WILL BE, THIS WILL BE A HOTLY CONTESTED ITEM AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THESE SOCKS WERE CONSCIENTIOUSLY AND INTENTIONALLY TAMPERED WITH IN AN EFFORT, IN A RUSH TO JUDGMENT TO GET EVIDENCE ON MR. SIMPSON WHERE YOU HAVE THE RESULTS PREDICTED BEFORE THE SOCKS EVER ARE SENT OUT TO THE LAB AND THE AMOUNT OF THIS DNA BEING EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT OF ALL THE REST OF THE BLOOD FOUND IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE.I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT IN ADDITION TO THIS, YOU CAN SEE THIS AREA IS VERY, VERY, VERY LIGHT AROUND HERE. THERE'S NO BLOOD FOUND ON THIS CARPET OR ON THAT RUG THAT'S AT THE FOOT OF HIS BED, THAT THERE'S NO BLOOD FOUND ON THE LIGHT CARPET ON THE STAIRS, IN THE HALLWAY FLOOR ON THE WAY UP.BECAUSE THE COURT HAS INDICATED I BELIEVE THAT WE'LL HAVE A JURY VIEW IN THIS CASE, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE FOR YOURSELF HOPEFULLY AT SOME TIME IN THE NEAR FUTURE THIS PARTICULAR AREA. YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF EXACTLY HOW IT LOOKS AND WHAT TOOK PLACE.I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT THE LAPD DID IN FACT DO SOME SEROLOGY ON THESE SOCKS AT SOME TIME, BUT THEY DID NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO THE DNA THAT WAS PREDICTED. SO WE THINK THIS WILL BE SOMETHING THAT YOU WILL FIND OF SOME GREAT AMOUNT OF INTEREST AND WILL BE A MAJOR ITEM LITIGATED DURING THE COURSE OF THIS PARTICULAR HEARING.I MENTIONED TO YOU EARLIER AS WE LEAVE THE SOCKS AND WHAT TOOK PLACE THAT I WANTED TO BRIEFLY COMPARE WITH YOU THE CONDUCT OF O.J. SIMPSON WITH THE CONDUCT OF THE OFFICERS, THE LAPD OFFICERS INVOLVED IN THIS CASE FOR THIS GENERAL AREA OF JUNE 13TH.LET'S TAKE FIRST OF ALL MR. SIMPSON.WE EXPECT THE EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT MR. SIMPSON IS IN CHICAGO ON A PREARRANGED LONG-STANDING TRIP FOR HERTZ TO PLAY GOLF, THAT HE GETS A CALL FROM DETECTIVE PHILLIPS IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS, THAT HIS WHOLE DEMEANOR AND EVERYTHING CHANGED OF COURSE, AND HE COMES BACK VOLUNTARILY.WHEN HE GETS BACK, HE COMES HOME AND HE MEETS WITH THE DETECTIVES. THEY ASK HIM TO COME DOWNTOWN. HE GOES DOWNTOWN AND HE MEETS WITH DETECTIVES WITHOUT ANY COUNSEL, THAT HE TALKS WITH THEM, THAT HE GIVES THEM BLOOD, DOES EVERYTHING THEY ASK HIM, THAT HE THEN COMES BACK HOME THAT AFTERNOON, JUNE 13TH IN THE AFTERNOON.MEANWHILE, THE DETECTIVES -- AND WE'LL START WITH DETECTIVE PHILLIPS -- DELAYED ALMOST 10 HOURS BEFORE THEY GET THE CORONER OUT THERE. AND WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THAT IN TRYING TO ESTABLISH THIS MAN'S INNOCENCE.THEY THEN GO FROM THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE TO ROCKINGHAM. ALL FOUR OF THEM, AS YOU KNOW, THEN CLIMB OVER THE WALL AND THEY MAKE THESE MISREPRESENTATIONS TO THE JUDGE.SO IN THEIR VERY FIRST CONTACT WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AT 10:45 ON JUNE 13TH, THEY DON'T TELL THE TRUTH THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW, BECAUSE, FIRST OF ALL, THEY KNOW HE'S ON A TRIP THAT WAS PLANNED, AND THEY SAY AN UNEXPECTED TRIP. WE HAVE SHOWN YOU THOSE THREE ITEMS EARLIER. THEY DON'T TELL THE JUDGE HOW THEY GET OVER THE WALL OR WHATEVER.SO THESE ARE THE THINGS THEY PUT IN A DECLARATION WHICH YOU'VE PREVIOUSLY SEEN ALREADY THAT DAY. THEY CONTINUE LOOKING AROUND IN A MASS TO FIND EVIDENCE. WE'VE TALKED ALREADY ABOUT HOW PEOPLE AT BOTH -- AT THE SCENE CERTAINLY AT BUNDY ARE TRAIPSING THROUGH THE EVIDENCE AND THAT SORT OF THING.THEY LATER THAT DAY AFTER MAKING CONTACT WITH MR. SIMPSON OR AT HIS HOME, THEY GO BACK DOWNTOWN WITH HIM. THEY QUESTION HIM, THEY TAKE HIS BLOOD. INSTEAD OF TAKING HIS BLOOD AND BOOKING IT LIKE THEY SHOULD HAVE IN THEIR OWN PROCEDURES, THEY TAKE THAT BLOOD AND COME SOME 20 MILES OR SO WEST BACK TO ROCKINGHAM, CARRY IT AROUND, SEIZE HIS TENNIS SHOES, DON'T BOOK THOSE UNTIL THE NEXT DAY, MISLABEL THE BLOOD -- IT'S TO BE 17. THEY LABEL IT 18. THE TENNIS SHOES -- THE SNEAKERS ARE 18.THESE ARE THE EXPERIENCED DETECTIVES IN THIS CASE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS CASE AS THE CASE PROGRESSES, WE WANT YOU TO CHARACTERIZE HOW THEY CONDUCTED THEMSELVES AND HOW O.J. SIMPSON CONDUCTED HIMSELF IN MAKING A JUDGMENT IN THIS CASE ON WHETHER OR NOT THE PROSECUTION WILL EVER PROVE THIS CASE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT.THERE WILL BE A NUMBER OF KEY WITNESSES IN THE CASE. WITHOUT GETTING INTO ANY OF THEM, ALL WITNESSES ARE IMPORTANT.I THINK ALL SIDES WILL AGREE THAT NO SIDE HAS A PRIORITY ON THE TRUTH, PRIORITY ON THE TRUTH. ALL WITNESSES SHOULD BE ACCORDED, AS THE COURT HAS INSTRUCTED YOU, IN LOOKING AT HOW YOU DETERMINE THE TRUTHFULNESS OF A WITNESS. YOU SHOULD DO THAT.THERE ARE OTHER MISCELLANEOUS POINTS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE AT THIS POINT WITH REGARD -- ONE OF WHICH IS WITH THE 911 TAPE. THE TAPE I HAVE IN MIND NOW IS THE ONE FROM OCTOBER 25TH, 1993.I BELIEVE YOU HEARD TESTIMONY THAT ONE OF THE OFFICERS WHO CAME OUT AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME -- AND THIS IS THE TIME WHEN MANY OF YOU SAID DURING VOIR DIRE, YOU HAD HEARD THIS PARTICULAR TAPE, WHEN THERE'S NO PHYSICAL INJURY OR WHATEVER, THERE WAS A DOOR DAMAGED -- IT WAS ALREADY DAMAGED, BUT IT WAS DAMAGED SOME MORE. MR. SIMPSON AGREES TO FIX THAT DOOR.YOU WILL HEAR WHAT'S ON THAT TAPE WITH REGARD TO WHAT MR. SIMPSON HAS TO SAY AND WHAT MRS. SIMPSON HAS TO SAY ABOUT HER INTENT AND HER THOUGHT. AND I THINK WHAT YOU WILL FIND THE EVIDENCE TO SHOW, THAT THIS ARGUMENT, THE ENTIRE ARGUMENT ON OCTOBER 25TH, 1993 WAS OVER PICTURE FRAMES OF FORMER LOVERS OR LOVERS WHILE THEY WERE AWAY AND SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER AND NOT HAVING BEEN REMOVED OR TAKEN OUT OF THE HOUSE AS THEY WERE STRIVING TO GET BACK TOGETHER, AS YOU KNOW, DURING THE LATTER PART OF 1993.AND ANOTHER AREA, IN LISTENING TO THE PROSECUTION'S OPENING STATEMENT, THERE WAS CERTAINLY A SUGGESTION THERE MAY BE SOME CONNECTION BETWEEN THE NOISES, THESE THUMPS ON THE WALL IF YOU WILL THAT WERE HEARD BY MR. KATO KAELIN SOMEWHERE AROUND 10:47 IN THE EVENING, THAT SOMEONE PRESUMABLY CLIMBING OVER THE FENCE -- THERE WILL BE TESTIMONY I THINK THERE IS A FENCE BACK THERE NEAR KATO'S ROOM -- AND ACCIDENTALLY DROPPING THE GLOVE WHERE DETECTIVE FUHRMAN CLAIMS THAT HE FINDS THAT GLOVE OF COURSE LATER ON IN THE MORNING.KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE WILL BE WE EXPECT TESTIMONY FROM ROSA LOPEZ ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE AND VOICES OVER IN THE SIMPSON COMPOUND 12:00 O'CLOCK ON UNTIL ABOUT 3:00 O'CLOCK SHE HEARS. IT'S NOT O.J.'S SIMPSON'S VOICE OUT THERE. SHE HEARS PEOPLE TALKING. SHE CAN'T GO TO SLEEP SHE SAYS.WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THIS WALKWAY, WHICH IS VERY, VERY NARROW, IS VERY, VERY NEAR WHERE SHE LIVES, KIND OF IN HER HOUSEKEEPER QUARTERS IN THE HOUSE RIGHT NEXT DOOR.WE EXPECT THE EVIDENCE TO BE THAT THE AREA WHERE DETECTIVE FUHRMAN CLAIMS THAT HE FOUND THIS PARTICULAR GLOVE IS AN AREA THAT HAS A NUMBER OF COBWEBS AND THINGS BACK THERE, WHICH ONE MIGHT INFER THAT PEOPLE HADN'T BEEN WALKING BACK THERE, HADN'T BEEN BACK THERE FOR A WHILE.I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL ALSO SHOW THAT ON THAT SIDE OF MR. SIMPSON'S HOME, IF MR. SIMPSON HAD WANTED TO COME HOME AND HIDE HIMSELF FROM ANYBODY OUTSIDE, THE LIMOUSINE DRIVER, THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO ENTRANCES TO HIS HOUSE ON THAT SIDE. THERE'S ONE DOOR THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT GOES INTO A LAUNDRY ROOM, AND OF COURSE THERE'S A DOOR INTO THE GARAGE, ALL ON THIS SIDE OF THE HOUSE (INDICATING).I'M MAKING THESE STATEMENTS BECAUSE I THINK THAT THIS IS WHAT THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW IN RESPONSE TO WHAT THE PROSECUTION HAS INDICATED.I THINK YOU WILL ALSO FIND THAT THERE WILL BE TESTIMONY THERE IS A GREAT AMOUNT OF VERY THICK SHRUBBERY ON TOP OF THAT FENCE THAT SEPARATES THE PROPERTY WHERE MISS LOPEZ LIVES AND WHERE MR. SIMPSON LIVES ON THAT DATE. AND I THINK YOU WILL HEAR TESTIMONY AS TO WHETHER OR NOT ANY OF THOSE TWIGS, LEAVES OR ANY OF THOSE ITEMS WERE EVER DISTURBED OR APPEARED TO BE DISTURBED AS THOUGH ANYBODY HAD CLIMBED ACROSS OR CLIMBED OVER THAT FENCE.NOW I WANT TO TURN OUR ATTENTION TO SOMETHING I ALLUDED TO THE LAST TIME. WE CALL IT THE TIME LINE.ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE EXPECT TO SHOW DURING THE COURSE OF THIS TRIAL IS NOT ONLY DID MR. SIMPSON NOT COMMIT THESE BRUTAL MURDERS, BUT HE DID NOT, WOULD NOT, COULD NOT WITHIN THE TIME FRAME HAVE COMMITTED THESE PARTICULAR KILLINGS OUT OF THE WITNESSES THAT BOTH SIDES KNOW ABOUT THAT WE UNDERSTAND.AND WHAT WE HAVE IS A TIME LINE WITH A CHART AND TIME LINE WITH THE GRAPHICS WHICH WE WOULD LIKE TO CALL TO YOUR ATTENTION NOW.WHAT'S THE NUMBER?

I TOUCHED UPON THAT BRIEFLY THE OTHER DAY.WITHOUT BELABORING THE POINT, AS YOU HEAR THIS TESTIMONY, I ASK YOU, AS WITH ALL THE EVIDENCE, KEEP AN OPEN MIND, TO REMEMBER THAT THE INCIDENT JANUARY 1ST, 1989 WAS THE ASSAULTIVE INCIDENT THAT MR. SIMPSON TOOK BLAME FOR, WROTE LETTERS OF APOLOGY.AND YOU WILL RECALL THE TESTIMONY, WE EXPECT TO BE, SHE WAS NEVER STRUCK AFTER THAT IN A PHYSICAL SENSE AND THAT IN FACT HE MADE AN AGREEMENT REGARDING THE PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT, THAT IF THERE WAS ANY PHYSICAL TOUCHING, THE PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT WOULD BE VOID. AT ANY RATE, THAT WAS NEVER DONE. EXPECT TO SHOW THAT.THAT WITH REGARD TO THIS ENTIRE DOMESTIC DISCORD EVIDENCE, THAT THERE WILL BE -- AND I ASK YOU TO BEAR IN MIND IN MANY INSTANCES WHERE THERE ARE MORE THAN ONE PERSON PRESENT, PLEASE KEEP AN OPEN MIND UNTIL YOU'VE HEARD THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE ALSO PRESENT AT THESE INCIDENTS SO YOU CAN MAKE A DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THIS HAS ANY BEARING AT ALL, BECAUSE IF YOU FOLLOW THE EVIDENCE, IF YOU BELIEVE MR. SIMPSON COULD NOT HAVE DONE IT, THAT THIS TIME LINE IS SUCH THAT THERE'S NO TIME FOR HIM TO DO IT, NO INDICATION THAT HE COULD HAVE DONE THIS, THAT THE BRONCO WAS STILL THERE, WHATEVER, THEN THE CHARACTER EVIDENCE WILL MEAN ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, BECAUSE HOW COULD YOU THEN PREDICT THAT SOMEONE WHO GETS INTO A FIGHT WITH HIS WIFE IN 1989 WILL THEN KILL HER IN 1994.ONE AREA THAT I DID NOT COVER EARLIER IS THE SEARCHING DONE IN THIS CASE. THEY HAVE SEARCHED EVERYWHERE IN THIS CASE FOR WEAPONS AND/OR CLOTHES, AND I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL BE THAT THEY SEARCHED EVEN IN CHICAGO, IN THE FIELDS AND THE WOODED AREAS IN CHICAGO, ALL UP AND DOWN ROCKINGHAM AND BUNDY AND EVERY PLACE THEY POSSIBLY COULD. THEY WORKED VERY HARD ON THIS CASE BECAUSE IN THEIR RUSH TO JUDGMENT, THEY FIXED ON THIS ONE INDIVIDUAL, AND THAT'S WHAT THEY FOCUSED ON WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY DID.MISS CLARK IN HER OPENING STATEMENT SAID THAT MR.

THIS IS NOT A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE.NOW, AS WE CONCLUDE FINALLY, AS I PROMISED YOU TODAY, I BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT --MAY WE APPROACH, YOUR HONOR? MAY WE APPROACH?

#MR. COCHRAN: ,"THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.WE EXPECT ALSO THAT THERE WILL BE EVIDENCE AND TESTIMONY THAT A SHORT TIME BEFORE MR. SIMPSON WENT TO CHICAGO, ON SUNDAY EVENING, JUNE 12TH, I THINK ON OR ABOUT JUNE 2ND, HIS SECRETARY AT HIS REQUEST ORDERED THE STAR 69 FEATURE AT HIS REQUEST ON HIS PHONE, AND WE EXPECT THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY ABOUT THAT AND AS TO WHY THAT WAS.IN SUMMARY, AS YOU THEN LOOK AT ALL OF THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE, WE EXPECT THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT O.J. SIMPSON, AS YOU SEE HIM THERE, IS NOT A PERFECT HUMAN BEING. HE, LIKE ALL OF US, HAS MADE MISTAKES. OF COURSE, WE KNOW THERE'S ONLY ONE PERFECT PERSON WHO EVER WALKED THE EARTH.WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW HE'S NOT GUILTY OF THESE HORRIBLE CRIMES, THAT HE HAS BEEN BLESSED BOUNTIFULLY BY GOD AND HE'S SHARED HIS LARGESSE AND BLESSINGS WITH MANY, MANY PEOPLE; THAT IN THIS INSTANCE, THE PROSECUTOR'S THEORY THAT THERE WAS ONLY ONE MURDERER IS JUST A THEORY. WE EXPECT TO INTRODUCE EVIDENCE TO SHOW THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE KILLER, THAT THE PROSECUTOR'S THEORY WILL BE OVERCOME BY THE FACTS WHICH WE PRESENT.WE ALSO EXPECT THAT THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THE REASON THE PROSECUTION MAINTAINS THERE'S ONLY ONE KILLER IS THAT MR. SIMPSON -- WHO THEY WANT TO PORTRAY AS A STALKER, AND STALKERS DON'T COME IN PAIRS. IT COULD ONLY BE ONE PERSON UNDER THAT SCENARIO. THAT EX-HUSBANDS WHO ARE STALKERS DON'T COME IN PAIRS AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE WEDDED TO THIS ONE MURDERER THEORY, EVEN CONTRARY TO WHAT THEIR OWN CORONER MAY VERY WELL INDICATE.I'VE SHARED WITH YOU ALSO THE FACT OF MR. GOLDMAN'S JOURNEY THAT EVENING WHEN HE CHECKED OUT AND WENT HOME, CHANGED CLOTHES AND EVERYTHING. SO I WILL NOT BELABOR THAT.EXPECT THERE WILL BE EVIDENCE ABOUT HOW YOU GET INTO 875 SOUTH BUNDY, WHEN ONE COMES UP AND RINGS THE BELL OR WHATEVER AND HOW YOU GET IN FROM THE HOUSE OR WHETHER THAT'S POSSIBLE, WHETHER SOMEBODY HAS TO LET YOU IN OR HOW YOU GET IN THE PARTICULAR RESIDENCE.I ALREADY TOLD YOU, WE EXPECT THERE WILL BE EVIDENCE OF THE SIZE OF THIS AREA. AND I THINK MISS CLARK HAS INDICATED AND I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW IT'S A VERY, VERY SMALL AREA, GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES.WE WILL SHOW THAT THE POLICE WHO CAME OVER TO BUNDY YOU WILL SEE WALKING THROUGH THAT SCENE WENT IN THAT HOUSE AND DIDN'T TAKE ONE PICTURE, PICTURE. THEY WENT IN THE HOUSE, THAT THEY FOUND CANDLES BURNING AND VARIOUS OTHER THINGS, THAT THE INVESTIGATION INSIDE THAT HOUSE WAS SHODDY AND SCARCE IF AT ALL UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.AND SO WHEN THIS CASE -- AS WITH MANY CASES, YOU WILL RECALL THAT WE TALKED TO YOU A LOT ABOUT TRUTH AND YOUR COMMON SENSE. DURING VOIR DIRE, I THINK WE -- ALL OF US TOLD YOU THAT WE WANTED YOU TO USE YOUR COLLECTIVE COMMON SENSE AND DON'T LEAVE IT OUTSIDE IN THE HALLWAY, TO BRING IT IN AND APPLY IT TO THE FACTS OF THIS PARTICULAR CASE.IN APPLYING THAT COMMON SENSE, AS I INDICATED TO YOU, YOU WILL LOOK AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THIS SMALL AREA. YOU WILL SEE THE FIGHT THAT MR. GOLDMAN PUT UP. YOU WILL SEE THE INJURIES THAT HE SUSTAINED. YOU WILL HEAR THE TESTIMONY ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF BLOOD TO BE EXPECTED ON THE PERPETRATOR. YOU HAVE SEEN MR. SIMPSON'S BODY, THE LACK OF SCRATCHES THEREON.YOU WILL SEE AND YOUR COMMON SENSE WILL ADDRESS BASED UPON THE EVIDENCE THE ISSUE OF WHETHER ONE PERSON COULD KILL TWO PEOPLE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WITHOUT HEARING SCREAMING AND A LOT OF RUNNING AND ALL SORT OF THINGS. WE EXPECT HOPEFULLY THAT THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED BY THE DEFENSE WILL HELP TO PROVIDE SOME ANSWERS TO THESE COMMON-SENSE QUESTIONS.WE EXPECT ALSO THAT YOU WILL HEAR FROM A WITNESS BY THE NAME OF PAULA BARBIERI. BOTH SIDES ARE AWARE OF HER. AND SHE WILL TESTIFY ABOUT HER RELATIONSHIP WITH MR. O.J. SIMPSON, SPECIFICALLY, AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, BETWEEN THE PERIOD MAY OF 1992 AND MAY OF 1993 AND MAY OF 1994 TO THE PRESENT.THIS CASE REALLY BOILS DOWN TO A WHO DONE IT, THIS CASE IS ABOUT. IT'S NOT ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR WHATEVER. IT'S ABOUT WHO KILLED THESE TWO PEOPLE AND THESE PARTICULAR HORRIBLE CRIMES. THE PROSECUTION WILL PROBABLY START OFF WITH DOMESTIC DISCORD EVIDENCE. AND THAT WITH ALL THE EVIDENCE, WE ASK YOU TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND.YOU KNOW THE CIRCUMSTANCES. YOU KNOW THERE ARE GENERALLY TWO SIDES TO EVERY SITUATION. WE CANNOT CALL OUR WITNESSES UNTIL WE GET OUR TIME IN THE PART OF THE CASE WHEN IT'S OUR TIME TO PUT THE WITNESSES ON.THAT'S WHY I'VE SPENT SO MUCH TIME IN THIS OPENING STATEMENT TO TRY TO DETAIL FOR YOU WHAT WE EXPECT THE EVIDENCE TO BE AND WHAT WE EXPECT TO SHOW. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE FACT THAT SOMEONE HAS AN ALTERCATION WITH ONE'S WIFE IN 1989 IS NOT CAPABLE OF BEING PREDICTED WHETHER THAT PERSON WOULD KILL HER OR BE INVOLVED IN ANY OTHER FIGHTS OR WHATEVER.

THAT BLOOD INDICATED A FAINT A ACTIVITY. IT WAS A FAINT A ACTIVITY THAT IS INDICATIVE OF THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT WAS HER BLOOD, IT WAS CONSISTENT WITH HER, AND SO THE CONCLUSION WAS INCONCLUSIVE, NOT THAT IT WAS NOT CONSISTENT WITH HER AT ALL.SO RIGHT NOW THE JURY IS SITTING THERE HAVING BEEN TOTALLY MISLED AS TO THE NATURE OF THE FINDINGS, NOT ONLY THAT, AND MISLED AS TO THE CONTENTS OF THE REPORT BECAUSE COUNSEL EXCERPTED PORTIONS UNFAIRLY.I UNDERSTAND COUNSEL DOESN'T HAVE TO READ THE WHOLE REPORT, BUT IT SHOULD BE READ WITH RESPECT TO ALL OF THE CONCLUSIONS, NOT JUST THE ONE THAT SUITS COUNSEL WITH RESPECT TO THIS PARTICULAR ITEM OF EVIDENCE, AND THAT IS WHAT WAS UNFAIR.WE WOULD ASK LEAVE OF THE COURT TO INFORM THE JURY OF THE FACT THAT THEY WERE MISLED, THAT THE REPORT ACTUALLY STATES AS FOLLOWS, AND TO HIGHLIGHT ALL OF THE PORTIONS.AT THIS POINT, YOUR HONOR, COUNSEL'S STATEMENTS TO THE JURY HAVE CAUSED, BECAUSE OF THE NATIONAL TELEVISED NATURE OF THIS TRIAL, THE WHOLE COUNTRY HAS BEEN MISLED AS TO THE TRUTH. THE TRUTH HAS BEEN HIDDEN, HAS BEEN OBSCURED BY COUNSEL WILLFULLY.COUNSELS KNOWS THE TRUTH, COUNSEL KNOWS WHAT WE HAVE IN THIS BLOOD, COUNSEL KNOWS THAT THE PGM SUBTYPING HAS SHOWN THAT IT IS HER BLOOD, AND COUNSEL KNOWS THAT TESTS ARE ONGOING, THAT IT WILL FURTHER ESTABLISH THAT IT IS HER BLOOD UNDER HER NAILS AND ON HER THIGH, BUT WE HAVE A WHOLE NATION HOW WHO HAS BEEN MISLED AS TO THE NATURE OF THIS EVIDENCE.BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, THAT THIS JURY HAS BEEN WILLFULLY MISLED AND BEEN MADE TO BELIEVE THAT THE CONCLUSIONS ARE DIAMETRICALLY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THEY REALLY WERE.SO WE WOULD ASK LEAVE OF THE COURT TO ADDRESS THE JURY WITH RESPECT TO THAT ITEM AS WELL.

IT IS A KNOWN THING WHICH IS WHY WHEN THERE IS EVIDENCE OF DEGRADATION AND YOU HAVE A B RESULT ON THE EAP, YOU CANNOT EXCLUDE THE BA AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE JURY HAS BEEN COMPLETELY MISLED ABOUT, NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT AT LEAST ON THE THIGH MARKER WHERE COUNSEL TOLD THE JURY THAT IT EXCLUDED HER AS WELL, THERE WAS FAINT A ACTIVITY, SO I MEAN --

COCHRAN RAISES THE SAME OBJECTION TO THE FIRESTONE VIDEOTAPE. IT IS APPARENT WHO IS THERE. IT IS MR. SIMPSON, IT IS MR. FIRESTONE AND THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THE '89 INCIDENT.BUT THERE IS STILL AN AUTHENTICATION FOUNDATION THAT HAS TO BE LAID. IT IS NOT INHERENTLY SELF-AUTHENTICATING.

AND A LETTER, THAT IS NOT FOUNDATIONAL, AND I THINK WE STILL HAVE A PROBLEM AND I DON'T THINK YOU CAN JUST BRING A CLERK IN HERE.WE ARE GOING TO OBJECT IF HE BRINGS A CLERK IN HERE TO TRY TO LAY SOME FOUNDATION FOR THIS PARTICULAR TAPE. AS YOU CORRECTLY POINTED OUT, JUDGE, WHEN WE WERE SEEKING TO SHOW A TAPE WHICH EVERYBODY HAD SEEN AT THE SCENE, THE COURT KEPT THAT OUT ON VARIOUS GROUNDS, BUT IT WAS A MONTAGE.THESE THINGS ARE CUT, PASTED, PUT TOGETHER, AND IT IS A REAL PROBLEM IF WE DON'T HAVE THE PERSON WHO DID THE CUT AND PASTING, IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE TRUTH AND GETTING THE FACTS OUT TO THE JURORS, IN WHICH THEY CLAIM THEY WANT TO DO, SO I WOULD -- I WOULD RESERVE FURTHER OBJECTION.AND I WAS REMINDED WHEN I RETURNED TO MY SEAT THAT WHAT COUNSEL HAD INDICATED WAS THAT THEY WERE GOING TO FILTER OR SOMETHING, USE THE WORDS ""FILTER"" WITH REGARDS TO THIS NOISE. WE ARE ENTITLED TO HAVE THAT TAPE JUST THE WAY IT IS, NOT ENHANCED, AND NOT FIDDLING WITH THE KNOBS, BUT THE WAY WE HEARD IT THERE, NOT SO THAT THEY CAN BRING UP SOMETHING TO TRY TO PROVE SOMETHING.FURTHER, THERE IS A FOUNDATIONAL PROBLEM WITH THAT TAPE.

THE PROSECUTION WILL SHOW YOU EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY.WE WILL SHOW YOU OUTTAKES OF AN EXERCISE VIDEOTAPE WHICH WAS MADE BY THE DEFENDANT ONLY TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE MURDERS. WE WILL SHOW YOU A PORTION OF THAT VIDEOTAPE TO DEMONSTRATE JUST WHAT THE DEFENDANT'S PHYSICAL CAPABILITIES REALLY WERE ON THE EVENING OF JUNE THE 12TH, 1994.IN IT YOU WILL SEE THE DEFENDANT, JUST TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE MURDERS, THAT HE WEIGHED 215 POUNDS, WHICH IS WHAT HE WEIGHED FIFTEEN YEARS AGO, THAT THE DEFENDANT PRIDED HIMSELF IN THAT TAPE ON BEING IN GOOD PHYSICAL CONDITION. YOU WILL SEE HIM DOING PUSH-UPS. YOU WILL SEE HIM LIFTING HIS ARMS OVERHEAD, YOU WILL SEE HIM STRETCHING, REACHING, THROWING JABS AND UPPERCUTS AND HE DOES THAT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES IN THIS TAPE. YOU WILL SEE HIM DOING TRUNK TWISTS.AND THIS TAPE TOOK HOURS TO MAKE AND THAT HE CAME BACK AFTER THAT DAY, WENT BACK THE NEXT DAY AND SPENT A LOT MORE TIME DOING THAT VERY SAME THING. WE ARE GOING TO SHOW YOU THAT TAPE DURING THE COURSE OF THIS TRIAL.SECOND OF ALL, COUNSEL MADE REFERENCE TO THE FACT THAT -- TO A STATEMENT THAT HOWARD WEITZMAN, WHO WAS THEN THE DEFENDANT'S ATTORNEY, WAS NOT PERMITTED TO BE PRESENT DURING THE INTERVIEW WITH THE POLICE OFFICERS ON JUNE THE 13TH.AND YOU WERE TOLD BY COUNSEL THAT THEY REFUSED, THE POLICE OFFICERS ACTUALLY REFUSED TO ALLOW MR. WEITZMAN TO REMAIN WITH THE DEFENDANT DURING THAT INTERVIEW. THAT IS COMPLETELY WRONG.AND IN FACT WHAT THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW IS THAT THE DETECTIVES ASKED MR. WEITZMAN TO STAY FOR THE INTERVIEW, BUT THAT HE DECLINED TO DO SO, STATING THAT HE WOULD PREFER TO GO OUT TO LUNCH AND THAT PRIOR TO THAT INTERVIEW HE HAD HAD APPROXIMATELY HALF AN HOUR ALONE WITH MR. SIMPSON TO TALK TO HIM, AFTER WHICH HE SAID, ""GO AHEAD,"" WENT OUT TO LUNCH, AND THAT IS WHAT THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW.AND THAT WAS AFTER THE DETECTIVES INVITED HIM TO COME IN AND SIT DURING THE INTERVIEW WITH HIM.NOW, LASTLY, YOU HEARD MR. COCHRAN TALK TO YOU ABOUT A WITNESS NAMED MARY ANNE GERCHAS. NOW, HE TOLD YOU ABOUT THIS WITNESS, HE SAID IT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT WITNESS, HE DISCUSSED AT SOME LENGTH WHAT SHE WOULD TESTIFY TO, TELLING YOU THAT SHE CLAIMED TO HAVE SEEN FOUR MEN ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDERS, AT LEAST TWO OF WHOM WERE HISPANIC, AT LEAST ONE OR TWO OF WHOM WERE WEARING A KNIT CAP, THAT SHE STATED SHE SAW THEM POSSIBLY RUNNING FROM THE AREA OF NICOLE SIMPSON'S CONDO ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDERS.NOW, YOU WILL BE HEARING A LOT MORE ABOUT MISS GERCHAS DURING THE COURSE OF THIS TRIAL, BUT RIGHT NOW I AM JUST GOING TO ADDRESS A FEW POINTS THAT THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT MR. COCHRAN DIDN'T TELL YOU ABOUT.FOR EXAMPLE, SHE SPOKE TO HER FRIEND SHEILA CARTER THE DAY AFTER THE MURDERS OF RON AND NICOLE. SHE TOLD HER FRIEND, SHEILA CARTER, THAT SHE WAS NOT EVEN AT BUNDY ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDERS.MARY ANNE GERCHAS HAD PLANNED TO GO AND LOOK FOR AN APARTMENT ON BRENTWOOD ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDERS ON JUNE THE 12TH. THE NEXT DAY SHE SPOKE TO SHEILA CARTER AND SAID SHE DID NOT GO TO BRENTWOOD ON THAT NIGHT AND SHE WAS GLAD BECAUSE THERE HAD BEEN MURDERS COMMITTED THERE THE NIGHT BEFORE.BUT MISS CARTER IS ALSO GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE. IN ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT SHE WILL TELL YOU THAT MISS GERCHAS TOLD HER SHE DID NOT GO TO BRENTWOOD ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDERS, SHE IS ALSO GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT ABOUT MISS GERCHAS' CREDIBILITY.SHE WILL TELL YOU ABOUT A STATEMENT WHICH PROVES THAT MISS GERCHAS IS ONE OF THESE PEOPLE WHO COMES OUT OF THE WOODWORK IN HIGH-PROFILE CASES SO THEY CAN GET INVOLVED.AND HERE IS WHAT MISS CARTER WILL TELL YOU:MISS GERCHAS WAS OBSESSED WITH THIS CASE AND SHE TALKED AS IF SHE KNEW THE DEFENDANT PERSONALLY. SHE SAID THAT MISS CARTER WOULD SEND HER TO THE STORE TO BUY EVERY ENQUIRER, EVERY STAR AND EVERY TABLOID PERTAINING TO THIS CASE, ANYTHING THAT TALKED ABOUT THE SIMPSON CASE.SHE WOULD READ IT ALL AND SHE WOULD SAVE IT AND TALK ABOUT THE CASE CONSTANTLY. BUT SHE SOMEHOW NEVER TOLD ANYONE THAT SHE HAD BEEN ON BUNDY ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDERS UNTIL THE TIME THAT ROBERT SHAPIRO STARTED THE HOTLINE REQUESTING THAT ANYONE WITH INFORMATION COME FORWARD AND CALL THAT HOTLINE NUMBER.AND IT WAS RIGHT AROUND THAT TIME THAT HE PUT OUT THE HOTLINE NUMBER THAT MARY ANNE GERCHAS STARTED TO SAY, WELL, MAYBE I WAS DRIVING BY THAT AREA, MAYBE I DID SEE SOMETHING.MR. COCHRAN ACCUSED US OF NOT TELLING YOU ABOUT HER AND WE DIDN'T BECAUSE WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT HER. AND IF YOU BELIEVE HER, SHE ASKED THE DEFENSE ATTORNEYS IF THEY WOULD TELL US ABOUT HER AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD. SHE SPOKE TO ROBERT SHAPIRO AND SHAPIRO'S PEOPLE TOLD HER NOT TO TALK TO ANYONE ABOUT HER STATEMENT, AND WHEN THEY FINISHED TAKING HER STATEMENT, THEY TOLD HER THEY WEREN'T GOING TO USE HER AS A WITNESS.THEY SPENT HOURS INTERVIEWING HER BACK ON JULY 10TH AND JULY 12 OF 1994 AND THEY NEVER TOLD US ABOUT HER.NOW THAT JURY INSTRUCTION COUNSEL SHOWED YOU ABOUT CREDIBILITY OF WITNESSES APPLIES TO ALL WITNESSES, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT MARY ANNE GERCHAS IS A KNOWN LIAR AND A SIMPSON CASE GROUPIE.THANK YOU FOR KEEPING AN OPEN MIND AND LISTENING TO ALL THE EVIDENCE.

","ALL RIGHT. OKAY.WELL, AT ANY RATE, AS YOU THINK ABOUT IT NOW, AT NO TIME WERE YOU EVER TOLD BY ANYONE THAT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON OR ANY LADY INSIDE THAT HOUSE EVER TOLD ANYONE THEY WERE BEING BEATEN THROUGH THE TRANSCRIBER; IS THAT CORRECT?
